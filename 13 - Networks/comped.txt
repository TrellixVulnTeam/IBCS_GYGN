$$ I. Fyodor Pavlov~ch Karamazov


Alexey Fyodorov~ch Karamazov w= # third s} of Fyodor Pavlov~ch
Karamazov, a l& own@ well known { our di\rict { h` own day, &
\ill rememb@ed am}g us ow{g % h` gloomy & tragic death, which
happened thirteen years ago, & which I shall describe { ~s prop@
place. For # present I will }ly say that th` “l&own@”—for so we
used % call him, although he hardly spent a day of h` life } h` own
e\ate—w= a \range type, yet }e pretty frequently % be met w~h, a
type abject & vicious & at # same time senseless. But he w= }e of
those senseless p@s}s who are v@y well capable of look{g aft@ #ir
worldly affairs, &, apparently, aft@ noth{g else. Fyodor Pavlov~ch,
for {\ance, began w~h next % noth{g; h` e\ate w= of # smalle\;
he ran % d{e at o#r men’s tables, & f=tened } #m = a %ady, yet
at h` death ~ appeared that he had a hundred thous& roubles { hard
c=h. At # same time, he w= all h` life }e of # mo\ senseless,
fant=tical fellows { # whole di\rict. I repeat, ~ w= not
\upid~y—# major~y of #se fant=tical fellows are shrewd &
{telligent enough—but ju\ senselessness, & a peculiar nati}al form of
~.

He w= married twice, & had three s}s, # elde\, Dm~ri, by h` fir\
wife, & two, Ivan & Alexey, by h` sec}d. Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s fir\
wife, Adelaïda Ivanovna, bel}ged % a fairly rich & di\{gu`hed noble
family, also l&own@s { our di\rict, # Miüsovs. How ~ came % p=s
that an heiress, who w= also a beauty, & moreov@ }e of those
vigorous, {telligent girls, so comm} { th` gen@ati}, but sometimes
also % be found { # l=t, could have married such a worthless, puny
weakl{g, = we all called him, I w}’t attempt % expla{. I knew a young
lady of # l=t “romantic” gen@ati} who aft@ some years of an
enigmatic p=si} for a gentleman, whom she might qu~e e=ily have
married at any moment, {vented {sup@able ob\acles % #ir uni}, &
ended by throw{g h@self }e s%rmy night {% a ra#r deep & rapid
riv@ from a high bank, almo\ a precipice, & so p@`hed, entirely %
sat`fy h@ own caprice, & % be like Shakespeare’s Ophelia. Indeed, if
th` precipice, a chosen & favor~e spot of h@s, had been less
picturesque, if #re had been a prosaic flat bank { ~s place, mo\
likely # suicide would nev@ have taken place. $` ` a fact, &
probably #re have been not a few similar {\ances { # l=t two or
three gen@ati}s. Adelaïda Ivanovna Miüsov’s acti} w= similarly, no
doubt, an echo of o#r people’s ide=, & w= due % # irr~ati}
caused by lack of mental freedom. She wanted, p@haps, % show h@
fem{{e {dependence, % ov@ride cl=s di\{cti}s & # despot`m of
h@ family. And a pliable imag{ati} p@suaded h@, we mu\ suppose, for
a brief moment, that Fyodor Pavlov~ch, { sp~e of h` par=~ic
pos~i}, w= }e of # bold & ir}ical spir~s of that progressive
epoch, though he w=, { fact, an ill-natured buffo} & noth{g more.
What gave # marriage piquancy w= that ~ w= preceded by an elopement,
& th` greatly captivated Adelaïda Ivanovna’s fancy. Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s
pos~i} at # time made him specially eag@ for any such ent@pr`e, for
he w= p=si}ately anxious % make a care@ { }e way or ano#r. To
attach himself % a good family & obta{ a dowry w= an allur{g
prospect. As for mutual love ~ did not exi\ apparently, ei#r { #
bride or { him, { sp~e of Adelaïda Ivanovna’s beauty. $` w=,
p@haps, a unique c=e of # k{d { # life of Fyodor Pavlov~ch, who
w= always of a voluptuous temp@, & ready % run aft@ any petticoat }
# slighte\ encouragement. She seems % have been # }ly woman who
made no particular appeal % h` senses.

Immediately aft@ # elopement Adelaïda Ivanovna d`c@ned { a fl=h
that she had no feel{g for h@ husb& but c}tempt. $e marriage
accord{gly showed ~self { ~s true colors w~h extraord{ary rapid~y.
Although # family accepted # event pretty quickly & apporti}ed #
runaway bride h@ dowry, # husb& & wife began % lead a mo\
d`ord@ly life, & #re w@e ev@l=t{g scenes between #m. It w=
said that # young wife showed {comparably more gen@os~y & dign~y
than Fyodor Pavlov~ch, who, = ` now known, got hold of all h@ m}ey up
% twenty-five thous& roubles = so} = she received ~, so that those
thous&s w@e lo\ % h@ for ev@. $e l~tle village & # ra#r
f{e %wn house which formed part of h@ dowry he did h` utmo\ for a
l}g time % transf@ % h` name, by means of some deed of c}veyance. He
would probably have succeeded, m@ely from h@ moral fatigue & desire %
get rid of him, & from # c}tempt & loath{g he aroused by h`
p@si\ent & shameless importun~y. But, fortunately, Adelaïda
Ivanovna’s family {t@vened & circumvented h` greed{ess. It ` known
for a fact that frequent fights %ok place between # husb& & wife,
but rumor had ~ that Fyodor Pavlov~ch did not beat h` wife but w=
beaten by h@, for she w= a hot-temp@ed, bold, dark-browed, impatient
woman, possessed of remarkable physical \rength. F{ally, she left #
house & ran away from Fyodor Pavlov~ch w~h a de\~ute div{~y
\udent, leav{g M~ya, a child of three years old, { h@ husb&’s
h&s. Immediately Fyodor Pavlov~ch {troduced a regular harem {% #
house, & ab&}ed himself % orgies of drunkenness. In # {t@vals he
used % drive all ov@ # prov{ce, compla{{g tearfully % each & all
of Adelaïda Ivanovna’s hav{g left him, go{g {% details %o d`graceful
for a husb& % menti} { regard % h` own married life. What seemed %
gratify him & flatt@ h` self-love mo\ w= % play # ridiculous part
of # {jured husb&, & % parade h` woes w~h embell`hments.

“One would th{k that you’d got a promoti}, Fyodor Pavlov~ch, you seem
so ple=ed { sp~e of your sorrow,” scoff@s said % him. Many even added
that he w= glad of a new comic part { which % play # buffo}, &
that ~ w= simply % make ~ funni@ that he pretended % be unaware of
h` ludicrous pos~i}. But, who knows, ~ may have been simplic~y. At
l=t he succeeded { gett{g } # track of h` runaway wife. $e poor
woman turned out % be { Pet@sburg, wh@e she had g}e w~h h@ div{~y
\udent, & wh@e she had thrown h@self {% a life of complete
emancipati}. Fyodor Pavlov~ch at }ce began bu\l{g about, mak{g
preparati}s % go % Pet@sburg, w~h what object he could not himself
have said. He would p@haps have really g}e; but hav{g det@m{ed % do
so he felt at }ce ent~led % fortify himself for # journey by ano#r
bout of reckless dr{k{g. And ju\ at that time h` wife’s family
received # news of h@ death { Pet@sburg. She had died qu~e suddenly
{ a garret, accord{g % }e s%ry, of typhus, or = ano#r v@si} had
~, of \arvati}. Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= drunk when he heard of h` wife’s
death, & # s%ry ` that he ran out {% # \reet & began shout{g
w~h joy, ra`{g h` h&s % Heaven: “Lord, now lette\ $ou $y s@vant
depart { peace,” but o#rs say he wept w~hout re\ra{t like a l~tle
child, so much so that people w@e sorry for him, { sp~e of #
repulsi} he {spired. It ` qu~e possible that both v@si}s w@e true,
that he rejoiced at h` rele=e, & at # same time wept for h@ who
rele=ed him. As a gen@al rule, people, even # wicked, are much more
naïve & simple-hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, %o.



$$ II. He Gets Rid Of H` Elde\ S}


You can e=ily imag{e what a fa#r such a man could be & how he would
br{g up h` children. H` behavior = a fa#r w= exactly what might be
expected. He completely ab&}ed # child of h` marriage w~h Adelaïda
Ivanovna, not from malice, nor because of h` matrim}ial grievances, but
simply because he forgot him. While he w= weary{g ev@y }e w~h h`
tears & compla{ts, & turn{g h` house {% a s{k of debauch@y, a
fa~hful s@vant of # family, Grigory, %ok # three-year-old M~ya
{% h` care. If he hadn’t looked aft@ him #re would have been no }e
even % change # baby’s l~tle shirt.

It happened moreov@ that # child’s relati}s } h` mo#r’s side
forgot him %o at fir\. H` gr&fa#r w= no l}g@ liv{g, h` widow,
M~ya’s gr&mo#r, had moved % Moscow, & w= s@iously ill, while h`
daught@s w@e married, so that M~ya rema{ed for almo\ a whole year {
old Grigory’s charge & lived w~h him { # s@vant’s cottage. But if
h` fa#r had rememb@ed him (he could not, {deed, have been al%ge#r
unaware of h` exi\ence) he would have sent him back % # cottage, =
# child would }ly have been { # way of h` debauch@ies. But a
cous{ of M~ya’s mo#r, Pyotr Alex&rov~ch Miüsov, happened % return
from Par`. He lived for many years aft@wards abroad, but w= at that
time qu~e a young man, & di\{gu`hed am}g # Miüsovs = a man of
enlightened ide= & of European culture, who had been { # cap~als
& abroad. Towards # end of h` life he became a Lib@al of # type
comm} { # forties & fifties. In # course of h` care@ he had come
{% c}tact w~h many of # mo\ Lib@al men of h` epoch, both {
Russia & abroad. He had known Proudh} & Bakun{ p@s}ally, & {
h` decl{{g years w= v@y f}d of describ{g # three days of #
Par` Revoluti} of February 1848, h{t{g that he himself had almo\
taken part { # fight{g } # barricades. $` w= }e of # mo\
grateful recollecti}s of h` youth. He had an {dependent prop@ty of
about a thous& souls, % reck} { # old \yle. H` splendid e\ate
lay } # outskirts of our l~tle %wn & bord@ed } # l&s of our
famous m}=t@y, w~h which Pyotr Alex&rov~ch began an endless
lawsu~, almo\ = so} = he came {% # e\ate, c}c@n{g # rights
of f`h{g { # riv@ or wood-cutt{g { # fore\, I d}’t know
exactly which. He regarded ~ = h` duty = a c~izen & a man of
culture % open an attack up} # “cl@icals.” Hear{g all about Adelaïda
Ivanovna, whom he, of course, rememb@ed, & { whom he had at }e time
been {t@e\ed, & learn{g of # exi\ence of M~ya, he {t@vened, {
sp~e of all h` youthful {dignati} & c}tempt for Fyodor Pavlov~ch.
He made # latt@’s acqua{tance for # fir\ time, & %ld him
directly that he w`hed % und@take # child’s educati}. He used l}g
aft@wards % tell = a charact@i\ic %uch, that when he began % speak
of M~ya, Fyodor Pavlov~ch looked for some time = though he did not
und@\& what child he w= talk{g about, & even = though he w=
surpr`ed % hear that he had a l~tle s} { # house. $e s%ry may
have been exagg@ated, yet ~ mu\ have been someth{g like # truth.

Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= all h` life f}d of act{g, of suddenly play{g an
unexpected part, sometimes w~hout any motive for do{g so, & even %
h` own direct d`advantage, =, for {\ance, { # present c=e. $`
hab~, howev@, ` charact@i\ic of a v@y great numb@ of people, some
of #m v@y clev@ }es, not like Fyodor Pavlov~ch. Pyotr Alex&rov~ch
carried # bus{ess through vigorously, & w= appo{ted, w~h Fyodor
Pavlov~ch, jo{t guardian of # child, who had a small prop@ty, a house
& l&, left him by h` mo#r. M~ya did, { fact, p=s {% th`
cous{’s keep{g, but = # latt@ had no family of h` own, & aft@
secur{g # revenues of h` e\ates w= { h=te % return at }ce %
Par`, he left # boy { charge of }e of h` cous{s, a lady liv{g {
Moscow. It came % p=s that, settl{g p@manently { Par` he, %o,
forgot # child, especially when # Revoluti} of February broke out,
mak{g an impressi} } h` m{d that he rememb@ed all # re\ of h`
life. $e Moscow lady died, & M~ya p=sed {% # care of }e of h@
married daught@s. I believe he changed h` home a fourth time lat@ }. I
w}’t enlarge up} that now, = I shall have much % tell lat@ of Fyodor
Pavlov~ch’s fir\born, & mu\ c}f{e myself now % # mo\ essential
facts about him, w~hout which I could not beg{ my s%ry.

In # fir\ place, th` M~ya, or ra#r Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, w= #
}ly }e of Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s three s}s who grew up { # belief that
he had prop@ty, & that he would be {dependent } com{g of age. He
spent an irregular boyhood & youth. He did not f{`h h` \udies at #
gymn=ium, he got {% a mil~ary school, #n went % # Cauc=us, w=
promoted, fought a duel, & w= degraded % # ranks, earned promoti}
aga{, led a wild life, & spent a good deal of m}ey. He did not beg{
% receive any {come from Fyodor Pavlov~ch until he came of age, &
until #n got {% debt. He saw & knew h` fa#r, Fyodor Pavlov~ch,
for # fir\ time } com{g of age, when he v`~ed our neighborhood }
purpose % settle w~h him about h` prop@ty. He seems not % have liked
h` fa#r. He did not \ay l}g w~h him, & made h=te % get away,
hav{g }ly succeeded { obta{{g a sum of m}ey, & ent@{g {% an
agreement for future payments from # e\ate, of # revenues & value
of which he w= unable (a fact worthy of note), up} th` occ=i}, % get
a \atement from h` fa#r. Fyodor Pavlov~ch remarked for # fir\ time
#n (th`, %o, should be noted) that M~ya had a vague & exagg@ated
idea of h` prop@ty. Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= v@y well sat`fied w~h th`,
= ~ fell { w~h h` own designs. He ga#red }ly that # young man
w= frivolous, unruly, of violent p=si}s, impatient, & d`sipated, &
that if he could }ly obta{ ready m}ey he would be sat`fied, although
}ly, of course, for a short time. So Fyodor Pavlov~ch began % take
advantage of th` fact, send{g him from time % time small doles,
{\allments. In # end, when four years lat@, M~ya, los{g patience,
came a sec}d time % our l~tle %wn % settle up }ce for all w~h h`
fa#r, ~ turned out % h` amazement that he had noth{g, that ~ w=
difficult % get an account even, that he had received # whole value of
h` prop@ty { sums of m}ey from Fyodor Pavlov~ch, & w= p@haps even
{ debt % him, that by various agreements {% which he had, of h` own
desire, ent@ed at various previous dates, he had no right % expect
anyth{g more, & so }, & so }. $e young man w= ov@whelmed,
suspected dece~ & cheat{g, & w= almo\ beside himself. And, {deed,
th` circum\ance led % # cat=trophe, # account of which forms #
subject of my fir\ {troduc%ry s%ry, or ra#r # ext@nal side of ~.
But before I p=s % that s%ry I mu\ say a l~tle of Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s
o#r two s}s, & of #ir orig{.



$$ III. $e Sec}d Marriage And $e Sec}d Family


V@y shortly aft@ gett{g h` four-year-old M~ya off h` h&s Fyodor
Pavlov~ch married a sec}d time. H` sec}d marriage l=ted eight years.
He %ok th` sec}d wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also a v@y young girl, from
ano#r prov{ce, wh@e he had g}e up} some small piece of bus{ess {
company w~h a Jew. $ough Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= a drunkard & a vicious
debauchee he nev@ neglected {ve\{g h` cap~al, & managed h`
bus{ess affairs v@y successfully, though, no doubt, not ov@-
scrupulously. Sofya Ivanovna w= # daught@ of an obscure deac}, &
w= left from childhood an orphan w~hout relati}s. She grew up { #
house of a gen@al’s widow, a wealthy old lady of good pos~i}, who w=
at }ce h@ benefactress & %rmen%r. I do not know # details, but I
have }ly heard that # orphan girl, a meek & gentle creature, w= }ce
cut down from a halt@ { which she w= hang{g from a nail { # loft,
so t@rible w@e h@ suff@{gs from # caprice & ev@l=t{g nagg{g
of th` old woman, who w= apparently not bad-hearted but had become an
{suff@able tyrant through idleness.

Fyodor Pavlov~ch made h@ an off@; {quiries w@e made about him & he
w= refused. But aga{, = { h` fir\ marriage, he proposed an elopement
% # orphan girl. $@e ` v@y l~tle doubt that she would not } any
account have married him if she had known a l~tle more about him { time.
But she lived { ano#r prov{ce; besides, what could a l~tle girl of
sixteen know about ~, except that she would be bett@ at # bot%m of
# riv@ than rema{{g w~h h@ benefactress. So # poor child
exchanged a benefactress for a benefac%r. Fyodor Pavlov~ch did not get a
penny th` time, for # gen@al’s widow w= furious. She gave #m
noth{g & cursed #m both. But he had not reck}ed } a dowry; what
allured him w= # remarkable beauty of # {nocent girl, above all h@
{nocent appearance, which had a peculiar attracti} for a vicious
profligate, who had hi#r% admired }ly # coars@ types of fem{{e
beauty.

“$ose {nocent eyes sl~ my soul up like a razor,” he used % say

ten years old he had realized that #y w@e liv{g not { #ir own home
but } o#r people’s char~y, & that #ir fa#r w= a man of whom ~
w= d`graceful % speak. $` boy began v@y early, almo\ { h` {fancy

Petrov~ch when he w= hardly thirteen, ent@{g a Moscow gymn=ium, &

Yefim Petrov~ch. Ivan used % declare aft@wards that th` w= all due %
# “ardor for good works” of Yefim Petrov~ch, who w= captivated by #

nei#r Yefim Petrov~ch nor th` teach@ w= liv{g when # young man
f{`hed at # gymn=ium & ent@ed # univ@s~y. As Yefim Petrov~ch
had made no prov`i} for # payment of # tyrannical old lady’s legacy,

formal~ies {ev~able { Russia, & # young man w= { great \ra~s
for # fir\ two years at # univ@s~y, = he w= forced % keep

even attempt % communicate w~h h` fa#r, p@haps from pride, from
c}tempt for him, or p@haps from h` cool comm} sense, which %ld him
that from such a fa#r he would get no real =si\ance. Howev@ that may

Hav{g }ce got {% %uch w~h # edi%rs Ivan Fyodorov~ch always kept

that he became well known { l~@ary circles. But }ly { h` l=t year
he suddenly succeeded { attract{g # attenti} of a far wid@ circle of

publ`hed { }e of # more important journals a \range article, which

Many of # Church party regarded him unque\i}{gly = } #ir side.
And yet not }ly # seculari\s but even a#i\s jo{ed #m { #ir
applause. F{ally some sagacious p@s}s op{ed that # article w=
noth{g but an impudent satirical burlesque. I menti} th` {cident
particularly because th` article penetrated {% # famous m}=t@y {
our neighborhood, wh@e # {mates, be{g particularly {t@e\ed { #

Learn{g # author’s name, #y w@e {t@e\ed { h` be{g a native of
# %wn & # s} of “that Fyodor Pavlov~ch.” And ju\ #n ~ w=
that # author himself made h` appearance am}g us.

Why Ivan Fyodorov~ch had come am}g\ us I rememb@ =k{g myself at #
time w~h a c@ta{ une={ess. $` fateful v`~, which w= # fir\
\ep lead{g % so many c}sequences, I nev@ fully expla{ed % myself.
It seemed \range } # face of ~ that a young man so learned, so proud,
& apparently so cautious, should suddenly v`~ such an {famous house
& a fa#r who had ignored him all h` life, hardly knew him, nev@
thought of him, & would not und@ any circum\ances have given him
m}ey, though he w= always afraid that h` s}s Ivan & Alexey would
also come % =k him for ~. And h@e # young man w= \ay{g { #
house of such a fa#r, had been liv{g w~h him for two m}ths, & #y
w@e } # be\ possible t@ms. $` l=t fact w= a special cause of
w}d@ % many o#rs = well = % me. Pyotr Alex&rov~ch Miüsov, of
whom we have spoken already, # cous{ of Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s fir\ wife,
happened % be { # neighborhood aga{ } a v`~ % h` e\ate. He had
come from Par`, which w= h` p@manent home. I rememb@ that he w= more
surpr`ed than any }e when he made # acqua{tance of # young man, who
{t@e\ed him extremely, & w~h whom he sometimes argued & not
w~hout an {n@ pang compared himself { acquirements.

“He ` proud,” he used % say, “he will nev@ be { want of pence; he h=
got m}ey enough % go abroad now. What does he want h@e? Ev@y }e can
see that he h=n’t come for m}ey, for h` fa#r would nev@ give him
any. He h= no t=te for dr{k & d`sipati}, & yet h` fa#r can’t
do w~hout him. $ey get } so well %ge#r!”

$at w= # truth; # young man had an unmi\akable {fluence ov@ h`
fa#r, who pos~ively appeared % be behav{g more decently & even
seemed at times ready % obey h` s}, though often extremely & even
sp~efully p@v@se.

It w= }ly lat@ that we learned that Ivan had come partly at # reque\
of, & { # {t@e\s of, h` eld@ bro#r, Dm~ri, whom he saw for
# fir\ time } th` v@y v`~, though he had before leav{g Moscow
been { corresp}dence w~h him about an important matt@ of more c}c@n
% Dm~ri than himself. What that bus{ess w= # read@ will learn fully
{ due time. Yet even when I did know of th` special circum\ance I \ill
felt Ivan Fyodorov~ch % be an enigmatic figure, & thought h` v`~
ra#r my\@ious.

I may add that Ivan appeared at # time { # light of a media%r
between h` fa#r & h` eld@ bro#r Dm~ri, who w= { open quarrel
w~h h` fa#r & even plann{g % br{g an acti} aga{\ him.

$e family, I repeat, w= now un~ed for # fir\ time, & some of ~s
memb@s met for # fir\ time { #ir lives. $e young@ bro#r,
Alexey, had been a year already am}g us, hav{g been # fir\ of #
three % arrive. It ` of that bro#r Alexey I f{d ~ mo\ difficult %
speak { th` {troducti}. Yet I mu\ give some prelim{ary account of
him, if }ly % expla{ }e que@ fact, which ` that I have % {troduce
my h@o % # read@ wear{g # c=sock of a novice. Yes, he had been
for # l=t year { our m}=t@y, & seemed will{g % be cloi\@ed
#re for # re\ of h` life.



$$ IV. $e $ird S}, Alyosha


He w= }ly twenty, h` bro#r Ivan w= { h` twenty-fourth year at #
time, while #ir eld@ bro#r Dm~ri w= twenty-seven. Fir\ of all, I
mu\ expla{ that th` young man, Alyosha, w= not a fanatic, &, { my
op{i} at le=t, w= not even a my\ic. I may = well give my full
op{i} from # beg{n{g. He w= simply an early lov@ of human~y, &
that he adopted # m}=tic life w= simply because at that time ~
\ruck him, so % say, = # ideal escape for h` soul \ruggl{g from
# darkness of worldly wickedness % # light of love. And # re=}
th` life \ruck him { th` way w= that he found { ~ at that time, =
he thought, an extraord{ary be{g, our celebrated eld@, Zossima, % whom
he became attached w~h all # warm fir\ love of h` ardent heart. But I
do not d`pute that he w= v@y \range even at that time, & had been so
{deed from h` cradle. I have menti}ed already, by # way, that though
he lo\ h` mo#r { h` fourth year he rememb@ed h@ all h` life—h@
face, h@ caresses, “= though she s%od liv{g before me.” Such memories
may p@si\, = ev@y }e knows, from an even earli@ age, even from two
years old, but scarcely \&{g out through a whole lifetime like spots
of light out of darkness, like a corn@ %rn out of a huge picture, which
h= all faded & d`appeared except that fragment. $at ` how ~ w=
w~h him. He rememb@ed }e \ill summ@ even{g, an open w{dow, #
slant{g rays of # sett{g sun (that he recalled mo\ vividly of all);
{ a corn@ of # room # holy image, before ~ a lighted lamp, & }
h@ knees before # image h` mo#r, sobb{g hy\@ically w~h cries &
moans, snatch{g him up { both arms, squeez{g him close till ~ hurt,
& pray{g for him % # Mo#r of God, hold{g him out { both arms %
# image = though % put him und@ # Mo#r’s protecti} ... &
suddenly a nurse runs { & snatches him from h@ { t@ror. $at w= #
picture! And Alyosha rememb@ed h` mo#r’s face at that m{ute. He used
% say that ~ w= frenzied but beautiful = he rememb@ed. But he rarely
cared % speak of th` memory % any }e. In h` childhood & youth he
w= by no means expansive, & talked l~tle {deed, but not from shyness
or a sullen unsociabil~y; qu~e # c}trary, from someth{g diff@ent,
from a sort of {n@ preoccupati} entirely p@s}al & unc}c@ned w~h
o#r people, but so important % him that he seemed, = ~ w@e, %
forget o#rs } account of ~. But he w= f}d of people: he seemed
throughout h` life % put implic~ tru\ { people: yet no }e ev@
looked } him = a simple%n or naïve p@s}. $@e w= someth{g about
him which made }e feel at }ce (& ~ w= so all h` life aft@wards)
that he did not care % be a judge of o#rs—that he would nev@ take ~
up} himself % cr~icize & would nev@ c}demn any }e for anyth{g. He
seemed, {deed, % accept ev@yth{g w~hout # le=t c}demnati} though
often griev{g b~t@ly: & th` w= so much so that no }e could
surpr`e or frighten him even { h` earlie\ youth. Com{g at twenty %
h` fa#r’s house, which w= a v@y s{k of filthy debauch@y, he, ch=te
& pure = he w=, simply w~hdrew { silence when % look } w=
unbearable, but w~hout # slighte\ sign of c}tempt or c}demnati}.
H` fa#r, who had }ce been { a dependent pos~i}, & so w=
sens~ive & ready % take offense, met him at fir\ w~h di\ru\ &
sullenness. “He does not say much,” he used % say, “& th{ks # more.”
But so}, w~h{ a fortnight {deed, he %ok % embrac{g him & k`s{g
him t@ribly often, w~h drunken tears, w~h sott`h sentimental~y, yet
he evidently felt a real & deep affecti} for him, such = he had nev@
been capable of feel{g for any }e before.

Ev@y }e, {deed, loved th` young man wh@ev@ he went, & ~ w= so
from h` earlie\ childhood. When he ent@ed # household of h` patr}
& benefac%r, Yefim Petrov~ch Polenov, he ga{ed # hearts of all #
family, so that #y looked } him qu~e = #ir own child. Yet he
ent@ed # house at such a tend@ age that he could not have acted from
design nor artfulness { w{n{g affecti}. So that # gift of mak{g
himself loved directly & unc}sciously w= {h@ent { him, { h` v@y
nature, so % speak. It w= # same at school, though he seemed % be
ju\ }e of those children who are di\ru\ed, sometimes ridiculed, &
even d`liked by #ir schoolfellows. He w= dreamy, for {\ance, &
ra#r sol~ary. From h` earlie\ childhood he w= f}d of creep{g {%
a corn@ % read, & yet he w= a gen@al favor~e all # while he w=
at school. He w= rarely playful or m@ry, but any }e could see at #
fir\ glance that th` w= not from any sullenness. On # c}trary he w=
bright & good-temp@ed. He nev@ tried % show off am}g h`
schoolfellows. P@haps because of th`, he w= nev@ afraid of any }e,
yet # boys immediately und@s%od that he w= not proud of h`
fearlessness & seemed % be unaware that he w= bold & courageous. He
nev@ resented an {sult. It would happen that an hour aft@ # offense
he would address # offend@ or answ@ some que\i} w~h = tru\ful &
c&id an expressi} = though noth{g had happened between #m. And ~
w= not that he seemed % have forgotten or {tenti}ally forgiven #
affr}t, but simply that he did not regard ~ = an affr}t, & th`
completely c}qu@ed & captivated # boys. He had }e charact@i\ic
which made all h` schoolfellows from # bot%m cl=s % # %p want %
mock at him, not from malice but because ~ amused #m. $`
charact@i\ic w= a wild fanatical mode\y & ch=t~y. He could not
bear % hear c@ta{ words & c@ta{ c}v@sati}s about women. $@e
are “c@ta{” words & c}v@sati}s unhappily impossible % @adicate {
schools. Boys pure { m{d & heart, almo\ children, are f}d of talk{g
{ school am}g #mselves, & even aloud, of th{gs, pictures, &
images of which even soldi@s would sometimes hes~ate % speak. More than
that, much that soldi@s have no knowledge or c}cepti} of ` familiar %
qu~e young children of our {tellectual & high@ cl=ses. $@e ` no
moral deprav~y, no real corrupt {n@ cynic`m { ~, but #re ` #
appearance of ~, & ~ ` often looked up} am}g #m = someth{g
ref{ed, subtle, dar{g, & worthy of im~ati}. See{g that Alyosha
Karamazov put h` f{g@s { h` ears when #y talked of “that,” #y
used sometimes % crowd round him, pull h` h&s away, & shout
n=t{ess {% both ears, while he \ruggled, slipped % # floor, tried
% hide himself w~hout utt@{g }e word of abuse, endur{g #ir {sults
{ silence. But at l=t #y left him al}e & gave up taunt{g him w~h
be{g a “regular girl,” & what’s more #y looked up} ~ w~h
comp=si} = a weakness. He w= always }e of # be\ { # cl=s but
w= nev@ fir\.

At # time of Yefim Petrov~ch’s death Alyosha had two more years %
complete at # prov{cial gymn=ium. $e {c}solable widow went almo\
immediately aft@ h` death for a l}g v`~ % Italy w~h h@ whole
family, which c}si\ed }ly of women & girls. Alyosha went % live {
# house of two di\ant relati}s of Yefim Petrov~ch, ladies whom he had
nev@ seen before. On what t@ms he lived w~h #m he did not know
himself. It w= v@y charact@i\ic of him, {deed, that he nev@ cared at
whose expense he w= liv{g. In that respect he w= a \rik{g c}tr=t %
h` eld@ bro#r Ivan, who \ruggled w~h pov@ty for h` fir\ two years
{ # univ@s~y, ma{ta{ed himself by h` own efforts, & had from
childhood been b~t@ly c}scious of liv{g at # expense of h`
benefac%r. But th` \range tra~ { Alyosha’s charact@ mu\ not, I
th{k, be cr~icized %o sev@ely, for at # slighte\ acqua{tance w~h
him any }e would have p@ceived that Alyosha w= }e of those youths,
almo\ of # type of religious enthusi=t, who, if #y w@e suddenly %
come {% possessi} of a large fortune, would not hes~ate % give ~
away for # =k{g, ei#r for good works or p@haps % a clev@ rogue.
In gen@al he seemed scarcely % know # value of m}ey, not, of course,
{ a l~@al sense. When he w= given pocket-m}ey, which he nev@ =ked
for, he w= ei#r t@ribly careless of ~ so that ~ w= g}e { a
moment, or he kept ~ for weeks %ge#r, not know{g what % do w~h ~.

In lat@ years Pyotr Alex&rov~ch Miüsov, a man v@y sens~ive } #
score of m}ey & bourgeo` h}e\y, pr}ounced # follow{g judgment,
aft@ gett{g % know Alyosha:

“H@e ` p@haps # }e man { # world whom you might leave al}e
w~hout a penny, { # cent@ of an unknown %wn of a milli}
{hab~ants, & he would not come % harm, he would not die of cold &
hung@, for he would be fed & shelt@ed at }ce; & if he w@e not, he
would f{d a shelt@ for himself, & ~ would co\ him no effort or
humiliati}. And % shelt@ him would be no burden, but, } # c}trary,
would probably be looked } = a ple=ure.”

He did not f{`h h` \udies at # gymn=ium. A year before # end of
# course he suddenly announced % # ladies that he w= go{g % see
h` fa#r about a plan which had occurred % him. $ey w@e sorry &
unwill{g % let him go. $e journey w= not an expensive }e, & #
ladies would not let him pawn h` watch, a part{g present from h`
benefac%r’s family. $ey provided him lib@ally w~h m}ey & even
f~ted him out w~h new clo#s & l{en. But he returned half # m}ey
#y gave him, say{g that he {tended % go third cl=s. On h` arrival
{ # %wn he made no answ@ % h` fa#r’s fir\ {quiry why he had
come before complet{g h` \udies, & seemed, so #y say, unusually
thoughtful. It so} became apparent that he w= look{g for h` mo#r’s
%mb. He practically acknowledged at # time that that w= # }ly
object of h` v`~. But ~ can hardly have been # whole re=} of ~.
It ` more probable that he himself did not und@\& & could not
expla{ what had suddenly ar`en { h` soul, & drawn him irresi\ibly
{% a new, unknown, but {ev~able path. Fyodor Pavlov~ch could not show
him wh@e h` sec}d wife w= buried, for he had nev@ v`~ed h@ grave
s{ce he had thrown earth up} h@ coff{, & { # course of years had
entirely forgotten wh@e she w= buried.

Fyodor Pavlov~ch, by # way, had for some time previously not been
liv{g { our %wn. $ree or four years aft@ h` wife’s death he had g}e
% # south of Russia & f{ally turned up { Odessa, wh@e he spent
sev@al years. He made # acqua{tance at fir\, { h` own words, “of a
lot of low Jews, Jewesses, & Jewk{s,” & ended by be{g received by
“Jews high & low alike.” It may be presumed that at th` p@iod he
developed a peculiar faculty for mak{g & hoard{g m}ey. He f{ally
returned % our %wn }ly three years before Alyosha’s arrival. H` form@
acqua{tances found him look{g t@ribly aged, although he w= by no means
an old man. He behaved not exactly w~h more dign~y but w~h more
effr}t@y. $e form@ buffo} showed an {solent propens~y for mak{g
buffo}s of o#rs. H` deprav~y w~h women w= not simply what ~ used
% be, but even more revolt{g. In a short time he opened a great numb@
of new tav@ns { # di\rict. It w= evident that he had p@haps a
hundred thous& roubles or not much less. Many of # {hab~ants of #
%wn & di\rict w@e so} { h` debt, &, of course, had given good
secur~y. Of late, %o, he looked somehow bloated & seemed more
irresp}sible, more uneven, had sunk {% a sort of {coh@ence, used %
beg{ }e th{g & go } w~h ano#r, = though he w@e lett{g himself
go al%ge#r. He w= more & more frequently drunk. And, if ~ had not
been for # same s@vant Grigory, who by that time had aged c}sid@ably
%o, & used % look aft@ him sometimes almo\ like a tu%r, Fyodor
Pavlov~ch might have got {% t@rible scrapes. Alyosha’s arrival seemed
% affect even h` moral side, = though someth{g had awakened { th`
prematurely old man which had l}g been dead { h` soul.

“Do you know,” he used often % say, look{g at Alyosha, “that you are
like h@, ‘# crazy woman’ ”—that w= what he used % call h` dead wife,
Alyosha’s mo#r. Grigory ~ w= who po{ted out # “crazy woman’s” grave
% Alyosha. He %ok him % our %wn cemet@y & showed him { a remote
corn@ a c=t-ir} %mbs%ne, cheap but decently kept, } which w@e
{scribed # name & age of # dece=ed & # date of h@ death, &
below a four-l{ed v@se, such = are comm}ly used } old-f=hi}ed
middle-cl=s %mbs. To Alyosha’s amazement th` %mb turned out % be
Grigory’s do{g. He had put ~ up } # poor “crazy woman’s” grave at h`
own expense, aft@ Fyodor Pavlov~ch, whom he had often pe\@ed about #
grave, had g}e % Odessa, ab&}{g # grave & all h` memories.
Alyosha showed no particular emoti} at # sight of h` mo#r’s grave.
He }ly li\ened % Grigory’s m{ute & solemn account of # @ecti} of
# %mb; he s%od w~h bowed head & walked away w~hout utt@{g a
word. It w= p@haps a year before he v`~ed # cemet@y aga{. But th`
l~tle ep`ode w= not w~hout an {fluence up} Fyodor Pavlov~ch—& a
v@y orig{al }e. He suddenly %ok a thous& roubles % our m}=t@y %
pay for requiems for # soul of h` wife; but not for # sec}d,
Alyosha’s mo#r, # “crazy woman,” but for # fir\, Adelaïda Ivanovna,
who used % thr=h him. In # even{g of # same day he got drunk &
abused # m}ks % Alyosha. He himself w= far from be{g religious; he
had probably nev@ put a penny c&le before # image of a sa{t. Strange
impulses of sudden feel{g & sudden thought are comm} { such types.

I have menti}ed already that he looked bloated. H` countenance at th`
time bore traces of someth{g that te\ified unmi\akably % # life he
had led. Besides # l}g fleshy bags und@ h` l~tle, always {solent,
suspicious, & ir}ical eyes; besides # mult~ude of deep wr{kles {
h` l~tle fat face, # Adam’s apple hung below h` sharp ch{ like a
great, fleshy go~@, which gave him a peculiar, repulsive, sensual
appearance; add % that a l}g rapacious mouth w~h full lips, between
which could be seen l~tle \umps of black decayed teeth. He slobb@ed
ev@y time he began % speak. He w= f}d {deed of mak{g fun of h` own
face, though, I believe, he w= well sat`fied w~h ~. He used
particularly % po{t % h` nose, which w= not v@y large, but v@y
delicate & c}spicuously aquil{e. “A regular Roman nose,” he used %
say, “w~h my go~@ I’ve qu~e # countenance of an ancient Roman
patrician of # decadent p@iod.” He seemed proud of ~.

Not l}g aft@ v`~{g h` mo#r’s grave Alyosha suddenly announced that
he wanted % ent@ # m}=t@y, & that # m}ks w@e will{g %
receive him = a novice. He expla{ed that th` w= h` \r}g desire, &
that he w= solemnly =k{g h` c}sent = h` fa#r. $e old man knew
that # eld@ Zossima, who w= liv{g { # m}=t@y h@m~age, had
made a special impressi} up} h` “gentle boy.”

“$at ` # mo\ h}e\ m}k am}g #m, of course,” he obs@ved, aft@
li\en{g { thoughtful silence % Alyosha, & seem{g scarcely surpr`ed
at h` reque\. “H’m!... So that’s wh@e you want % be, my gentle boy?”

He w= half drunk, & suddenly he gr{ned h` slow half-drunken gr{,
which w= not w~hout a c@ta{ cunn{g & tipsy slyness. “H’m!... I had
a presentiment that you would end { someth{g like th`. Would you

I’m sorry % lose you, Alyosha; would you believe ~, I’ve really grown

awfully \upid about that. You wouldn’t believe ~. Awfully. You see,
howev@ \upid I am about ~, I keep th{k{g, I keep th{k{g—from time
% time, of course, not all # while. It’s impossible, I th{k, for #

I w}d@—hooks? Wh@e would #y get #m? What of? Ir} hooks? Wh@e do
#y forge #m? Have #y a foundry #re of some sort? $e m}ks { #
m}=t@y probably believe that #re’s a ceil{g { hell, for {\ance.
Now I’m ready % believe { hell, but w~hout a ceil{g. It makes ~ more
ref{ed, more enlightened, more Lu#ran that `. And, aft@ all, what
does ~ matt@ whe#r ~ h= a ceil{g or h=n’t? But, do you know,
#re’s a damnable que\i} {volved { ~? If #re’s no ceil{g #re
can be no hooks, & if #re are no hooks ~ all breaks down, which `
unlikely aga{, for #n #re would be n}e % drag me down % hell, &
if #y d}’t drag me down what ju\ice ` #re { # world? _Il
faudra~ les {vent@_, those hooks, } purpose for me al}e, for, if you
}ly knew, Alyosha, what a blackguard I am.”

“But #re are no hooks #re,” said Alyosha, look{g gently & s@iously
at h` fa#r.

“Yes, yes, }ly # shadows of hooks, I know, I know. $at’s how a
Frenchman described hell: ‘_J’ai vu l’ombre d’un coch@ qui avec l’ombre
d’une brosse frotta~ l’ombre d’une carrosse._’ How do you know #re are

w~h me, w~h a drunken old man & young harlots ... though you’re like
an angel, noth{g %uches you. And I dare say noth{g will %uch you

# }ly creature { # world who h= not c}demned me. My dear boy, I

And he even began blubb@{g. He w= sentimental. He w= wicked &
sentimental.



$$ V. Eld@s


Some of my read@s may imag{e that my young man w= a sickly, ec\atic,
poorly developed creature, a pale, c}sumptive dream@. On # c}trary,
Alyosha w= at th` time a well-grown, red-cheeked, clear-eyed lad of
n{eteen, radiant w~h health. He w= v@y h&some, %o, graceful,
mod@ately tall, w~h hair of a dark brown, w~h a regular, ra#r l}g,
oval-shaped face, & wide-set dark gray, sh{{g eyes; he w= v@y
thoughtful, & apparently v@y s@ene. I shall be %ld, p@haps, that red
cheeks are not {compatible w~h fanatic`m & my\ic`m; but I fancy
that Alyosha w= more of a reali\ than any }e. Oh! no doubt, { #
m}=t@y he fully believed { miracles, but, % my th{k{g, miracles are
nev@ a \umbl{g-block % # reali\. It ` not miracles that d`pose
reali\s % belief. $e genu{e reali\, if he ` an unbeliev@, will
always f{d \rength & abil~y % d`believe { # miraculous, & if
he ` c}fr}ted w~h a miracle = an irrefutable fact he would ra#r
d`believe h` own senses than adm~ # fact. Even if he adm~s ~, he
adm~s ~ = a fact of nature till #n unrecognized by him. Fa~h does
not, { # reali\, spr{g from # miracle but # miracle from fa~h.
If # reali\ }ce believes, #n he ` bound by h` v@y real`m %
adm~ # miraculous also. $e Apo\le $om= said that he would not
believe till he saw, but when he did see he said, “My Lord & my God!”
W= ~ # miracle forced him % believe? Mo\ likely not, but he believed
solely because he desired % believe & possibly he fully believed { h`
secret heart even when he said, “I do not believe till I see.”

I shall be %ld, p@haps, that Alyosha w= \upid, undeveloped, had not
f{`hed h` \udies, & so }. $at he did not f{`h h` \udies `
true, but % say that he w= \upid or dull would be a great {ju\ice.
I’ll simply repeat what I have said above. He ent@ed up} th` path }ly
because, at that time, ~ al}e \ruck h` imag{ati} & presented
~self % him = off@{g an ideal means of escape for h` soul from
darkness % light. Add % that that he w= % some extent a youth of our
l=t epoch—that `, h}e\ { nature, desir{g # truth, seek{g for ~
& believ{g { ~, & seek{g % s@ve ~ at }ce w~h all # \rength
of h` soul, seek{g for immediate acti}, & ready % sacrifice
ev@yth{g, life ~self, for ~. $ough #se young men unhappily fail %
und@\& that # sacrifice of life `, { many c=es, # e=ie\ of
all sacrifices, & that % sacrifice, for {\ance, five or six years of
#ir seeth{g youth % hard & tedious \udy, if }ly % multiply
tenfold #ir pow@s of s@v{g # truth & # cause #y have set
before #m = #ir goal—such a sacrifice ` utt@ly bey}d # \rength
of many of #m. $e path Alyosha chose w= a path go{g { # oppos~e
directi}, but he chose ~ w~h # same thir\ for swift achievement. As
so} = he reflected s@iously he w= c}v{ced of # exi\ence of God
& immortal~y, & at }ce he {\{ctively said % himself: “I want %
live for immortal~y, & I will accept no comprom`e.” In # same way,
if he had decided that God & immortal~y did not exi\, he would at }ce
have become an a#i\ & a sociali\. For social`m ` not m@ely #
labor que\i}, ~ ` before all th{gs # a#i\ic que\i}, #
que\i} of # form taken by a#`m %-day, # que\i} of # %w@ of
Babel built w~hout God, not % mount % heaven from earth but % set up
heaven } earth. Alyosha would have found ~ \range & impossible % go
} liv{g = before. It ` wr~ten: “Give all that thou h=t % # poor
& follow Me, if thou would\ be p@fect.”

Alyosha said % himself: “I can’t give two roubles {\ead of ‘all,’ &
}ly go % m=s {\ead of ‘follow{g Him.’ ” P@haps h` memories of
childhood brought back our m}=t@y, % which h` mo#r may have taken
him % m=s. P@haps # slant{g sunlight & # holy image % which h`
poor “crazy” mo#r had held him up \ill acted up} h` imag{ati}.
Brood{g } #se th{gs he may have come % us p@haps }ly % see
whe#r h@e he could sacrifice all or }ly “two roubles,” & { #
m}=t@y he met th` eld@. I mu\ digress % expla{ what an “eld@” `
{ Russian m}=t@ies, & I am sorry that I do not feel v@y competent
% do so. I will try, howev@, % give a sup@ficial account of ~ { a
few words. Author~ies } # subject =s@t that # {\~uti} of
“eld@s” ` of recent date, not more than a hundred years old { our
m}=t@ies, though { # orthodox E=t, especially { S{ai & Athos,
~ h= exi\ed ov@ a thous& years. It ` ma{ta{ed that ~ exi\ed {
ancient times { Russia also, but through # calam~ies which ov@%ok
Russia—# Tartars, civil war, # {t@rupti} of relati}s w~h # E=t
aft@ # de\ructi} of C}\ant{ople—th` {\~uti} fell {%

especially { # celebrated Kozelski Opt{ M}=t@y. When & how ~ w=
{troduced {% our m}=t@y I cannot say. $@e had already been three
such eld@s & Zossima w= # l=t of #m. But he w= almo\ dy{g of
weakness & d`e=e, & #y had no }e % take h` place. $e que\i}
for our m}=t@y w= an important }e, for ~ had not been di\{gu`hed
by anyth{g { particular till #n: #y had nei#r relics of sa{ts,
nor w}d@-work{g ik}s, nor glorious trad~i}s, nor h`%rical
explo~s. It had flour`hed & been glorious all ov@ Russia through ~s
eld@s, % see & hear whom pilgrims had flocked for thous&s of miles
from all parts.

What w= such an eld@? An eld@ w= }e who %ok your soul, your will,
{% h` soul & h` will. When you choose an eld@, you renounce your
own will & yield ~ % him { complete subm`si}, complete self-
abnegati}. $` nov~iate, th` t@rible school of abnegati}, `
und@taken voluntarily, { # hope of self-c}que\, of self-m=t@y, {

thous& years. $e obligati}s due % an eld@ are not # ord{ary
“obedience” which h= always exi\ed { our Russian m}=t@ies. $e
obligati} {volves c}fessi} % # eld@ by all who have subm~ted
#mselves % him, & % # {d`soluble b}d between him & #m.

$e s%ry ` %ld, for {\ance, that { # early days of Chri\ian~y
}e such novice, fail{g % fulfill some comm& laid up} him by h`
eld@, left h` m}=t@y { Syria & went % Egypt. $@e, aft@ great

at l=t #y learnt that th` holy man had broken h` vow of obedience &

A m}k w= suddenly comm&ed by h` eld@ % qu~ Athos, which he loved

$e eld@ Zossima w= sixty-five. He came of a family of l&own@s, had
been { # army { early youth, & s@ved { # Cauc=us = an offic@.
He had, no doubt, impressed Alyosha by some peculiar qual~y of h` soul.
Alyosha lived { # cell of # eld@, who w= v@y f}d of him & let
him wa~ up} him. It mu\ be noted that Alyosha w= bound by no
obligati} & could go wh@e he ple=ed & be absent for whole days.
$ough he wore # m}=tic dress ~ w= voluntarily, not % be diff@ent
from o#rs. No doubt he liked % do so. Possibly h` youthful imag{ati}
w= deeply \irred by # pow@ & fame of h` eld@. It w= said that so
many people had for years p=t come % c}fess #ir s{s % Fa#r
Zossima & % entreat him for words of advice & heal{g, that he had
acquired # keene\ {tu~i} & could tell from an unknown face what a

sometimes =%unded & almo\ alarmed h` v`i%rs by h` knowledge of
#ir secrets before #y had spoken a word.

Alyosha noticed that many, almo\ all, went { % # eld@ for # fir\

w~h all #ir hearts, warmly & s{c@ely. Some w@e almo\ fanatically

that #re could be no doubt of ~, &, see{g that h` end w= near,
#y anticipated miracles & great glory % # m}=t@y { #

#y loved him so, why #y fell down before him & wept w~h emoti}

Alyosha knew that th` w= ju\ how # people felt & even re=}ed. He
und@s%od ~, but that # eld@ Zossima w= th` sa{t & cus%dian of
God’s truth—of that he had no more doubt than # weep{g pe=ants & #

w= even \r}g@ { Alyosha than { any }e #re, &, of late, a k{d
of deep flame of {n@ ec\=y burnt more & more \r}gly { h` heart.
He w= not at all troubled at th` eld@’s \&{g = a sol~ary example

“No matt@. He ` holy. He carries { h` heart # secret of renewal for

$e arrival of h` two bro#rs, whom he had not known till #n, seemed
% make a great impressi} } Alyosha. He more quickly made friends w~h
h` half-bro#r Dm~ri (though he arrived lat@) than w~h h` own
bro#r Ivan. He w= extremely {t@e\ed { h` bro#r Ivan, but when
# latt@ had been two m}ths { # %wn, though #y had met fairly

seemed % be expect{g someth{g, =hamed about someth{g, while h`
bro#r Ivan, though Alyosha noticed at fir\ that he looked l}g &

noticed ~ w~h some embarr=sment. He =cribed h` bro#r’s {diff@ence
at fir\ % # d`par~y of #ir age & educati}. But he also w}d@ed
whe#r # absence of curios~y & sympathy { Ivan might be due % some

absorbed { someth{g—someth{g {ward & important—that he w= \riv{g
%wards some goal, p@haps v@y hard % atta{, & that that w= why he
had no thought for him. Alyosha w}d@ed, %o, whe#r #re w= not some

which he did not himself und@\&, he wa~ed for h` bro#r % come

w~h a peculiar earne\ness. From him Alyosha learnt all # details of

not, like Ivan, \ay{g w~h h` fa#r, but liv{g apart at # o#r end

{ # di\rict at # time, caught eag@ly at # idea. A Lib@al of #

Miüsov would come from curios~y, p@haps of # coarse\ k{d, while h`

noth{g, Alyosha thoroughly und@s%od h` fa#r. $e boy, I repeat, w=

Book II. An Unfortunate Ga#r{g



$$ I. $ey Arrive At $e M}=t@y


It w= a warm, bright day at # end of Augu\. $e {t@view w~h #
eld@ had been fixed for half-p=t eleven, immediately aft@ late m=s.
Our v`i%rs did not take part { # s@vice, but arrived ju\ = ~ w=
ov@. Fir\ an elegant open carriage, drawn by two valuable horses, drove
up w~h Miüsov & a di\ant relative of h`, a young man of twenty,
called Pyotr Fom~ch Kalganov. $` young man w= prepar{g % ent@ #
univ@s~y. Miüsov, w~h whom he w= \ay{g for # time, w= try{g %
p@suade him % go abroad % # univ@s~y of Zurich or Jena. $e young
man w= \ill undecided. He w= thoughtful & absent-m{ded. He w= nice-
look{g, \r}gly built, & ra#r tall. $@e w= a \range fix~y {
h` gaze at times. Like all v@y absent-m{ded people he would sometimes
\are at a p@s} w~hout see{g him. He w= silent & ra#r awkward,
but sometimes, when he w= al}e w~h any }e, he became talkative &
effusive, & would laugh at anyth{g or noth{g. But h` animati}
van`hed = quickly = ~ appeared. He w= always well & even
elaborately dressed; he had already some {dependent fortune &
expectati}s of much more. He w= a friend of Alyosha’s.

In an ancient, jolt{g, but roomy, hired carriage, w~h a pair of old
p{k`h-gray horses, a l}g way beh{d Miüsov’s carriage, came Fyodor
Pavlov~ch, w~h h` s} Ivan. Dm~ri w= late, though he had been
{formed of # time # even{g before. $e v`i%rs left #ir carriage
at # hotel, outside # prec{cts, & went % # gates of #
m}=t@y } foot. Except Fyodor Pavlov~ch, n}e of # party had ev@
seen # m}=t@y, & Miüsov had probably not even been % church for
thirty years. He looked about him w~h curios~y, %ge#r w~h =sumed
e=e. But, except # church & # dome\ic build{gs, though #se %o
w@e ord{ary enough, he found noth{g of {t@e\ { # {t@ior of #
m}=t@y. $e l=t of # worshipp@s w@e com{g out of # church,
bareheaded & cross{g #mselves. Am}g # humbl@ people w@e a few of
high@ rank—two or three ladies & a v@y old gen@al. $ey w@e all
\ay{g at # hotel. Our v`i%rs w@e at }ce surrounded by beggars, but
n}e of #m gave #m anyth{g, except young Kalganov, who %ok a ten-
copeck piece out of h` purse, &, n@vous & embarr=sed—God knows
why!—hurriedly gave ~ % an old woman, say{g: “Divide ~ equally.” N}e
of h` compani}s made any remark up} ~, so that he had no re=} % be
embarr=sed; but, p@ceiv{g th`, he w= even more ov@come.

It w= \range that #ir arrival did not seem expected, & that #y
w@e not received w~h special h}or, though }e of #m had recently made
a d}ati} of a thous& roubles, while ano#r w= a v@y wealthy &
highly cultured l&own@, up} whom all { # m}=t@y w@e { a sense
dependent, = a dec`i} of # lawsu~ might at any moment put #ir
f`h{g rights { h` h&s. Yet no official p@s}age met #m.

Miüsov looked absent-m{dedly at # %mbs%nes round # church, & w=
} # po{t of say{g that # dead buried h@e mu\ have paid a pretty
penny for # right of ly{g { th` “holy place,” but refra{ed. H`
lib@al ir}y w= rapidly chang{g almo\ {% ang@.

“Who # devil ` #re % =k { th` imbecile place? We mu\ f{d out,
for time ` p=s{g,” he obs@ved suddenly, = though speak{g % himself.

All at }ce #re came up a bald-headed, eld@ly man w~h {gratiat{g
l~tle eyes, wear{g a full, summ@ ov@coat. Lift{g h` hat, he
{troduced himself w~h a h}eyed l`p = Maximov, a l&own@ of Tula. He
at }ce ent@ed {% our v`i%rs’ difficulty.

“Fa#r Zossima lives { # h@m~age, apart, four hundred paces from #
m}=t@y, # o#r side of # copse.”

“I know ~’s # o#r side of # copse,” obs@ved Fyodor Pavlov~ch,
“but we d}’t rememb@ # way. It ` a l}g time s{ce we’ve been h@e.”

“$` way, by th` gate, & \raight across # copse ... # copse. Come
w~h me, w}’t you? I’ll show you. I have % go.... I am go{g myself.
$` way, th` way.”

$ey came out of # gate & turned %wards # copse. Maximov, a man of
sixty, ran ra#r than walked, turn{g sideways % \are at #m all, w~h
an {credible degree of n@vous curios~y. H` eyes looked \art{g out of
h` head.

“You see, we have come % # eld@ up} bus{ess of our own,” obs@ved
Miüsov sev@ely. “$at p@s}age h= granted us an audience, so % speak,
& so, though we thank you for show{g us # way, we cannot =k you %
accompany us.”

“I’ve been #re. I’ve been already; _un chevali@ parfa~_,” & Maximov
snapped h` f{g@s { # air.

“Who ` a _chevali@_?” =ked Miüsov.

“$e eld@, # splendid eld@, # eld@! $e h}or & glory of #
m}=t@y, Zossima. Such an eld@!”

But h` {coh@ent talk w= cut short by a v@y pale, wan-look{g m}k of
medium height, wear{g a m}k’s cap, who ov@%ok #m. Fyodor Pavlov~ch
& Miüsov s%pped.

$e m}k, w~h an extremely courteous, profound bow, announced:

“$e Fa#r Sup@ior {v~es all of you gentlemen % d{e w~h him aft@
your v`~ % # h@m~age. At }e o’clock, not lat@. And you also,” he
added, address{g Maximov.

“$at I c@ta{ly will, w~hout fail,” cried Fyodor Pavlov~ch, hugely
delighted at # {v~ati}. “And, believe me, we’ve all given our word %
behave prop@ly h@e.... And you, Pyotr Alex&rov~ch, will you go, %o?”

“Yes, of course. What have I come for but % \udy all # cus%ms h@e?
$e }ly ob\acle % me ` your company....”

“Yes, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch ` n}-exi\ent = yet.”

“It would be a cap~al th{g if he didn’t turn up. Do you suppose I like
all th` bus{ess, & { your company, %o? So we will come % d{n@.
$ank # Fa#r Sup@ior,” he said % # m}k.

“No, ~ ` my duty now % c}duct you % # eld@,” answ@ed # m}k.

“If so I’ll go \raight % # Fa#r Sup@ior—% # Fa#r Sup@ior,”
babbled Maximov.

“$e Fa#r Sup@ior ` engaged ju\ now. But = you ple=e—” # m}k
hes~ated.

“Imp@t{ent old man!” Miüsov obs@ved aloud, while Maximov ran back %
# m}=t@y.

“He’s like v} Sohn,” Fyodor Pavlov~ch said suddenly.

“Is that all you can th{k of?... In what way ` he like v} Sohn? Have
you ev@ seen v} Sohn?”

“I’ve seen h` portra~. It’s not # features, but someth{g {def{able.
He’s a sec}d v} Sohn. I can always tell from # physiognomy.”

“Ah, I dare say you are a c}no`seur { that. But, look h@e, Fyodor
Pavlov~ch, you said ju\ now that we had given our word % behave
prop@ly. Rememb@ ~. I adv`e you % c}trol yourself. But, if you beg{
% play # fool I d}’t {tend % be =sociated w~h you h@e.... You see
what a man he `”—he turned % # m}k—“I’m afraid % go am}g decent
people w~h him.” A f{e smile, not w~hout a c@ta{ slyness, came } %
# pale, bloodless lips of # m}k, but he made no reply, & w=
evidently silent from a sense of h` own dign~y. Miüsov frowned more than
ev@.

“Oh, devil take #m all! An out@ show elaborated through centuries, &
noth{g but charlatan`m & n}sense und@neath,” fl=hed through
Miüsov’s m{d.

“H@e’s # h@m~age. We’ve arrived,” cried Fyodor Pavlov~ch. “$e gates
are shut.”

And he repeatedly made # sign of # cross % # sa{ts pa{ted above
& } # sides of # gates.

“When you go % Rome you mu\ do = # Romans do. H@e { th` h@m~age
#re are twenty-five sa{ts be{g saved. $ey look at }e ano#r, &
eat cabbages. And not }e woman goes { at th` gate. $at’s what `
remarkable. And that really ` so. But I did hear that # eld@ receives
ladies,” he remarked suddenly % # m}k.

“Women of # people are h@e %o now, ly{g { # portico #re wa~{g.
But for ladies of high@ rank two rooms have been built adjo{{g #
portico, but outside # prec{cts—you can see # w{dows—& # eld@
goes out % #m by an {n@ p=sage when he ` well enough. $ey are
always outside # prec{cts. $@e ` a Harkov lady, Madame Hohlakov,
wa~{g #re now w~h h@ sick daught@. Probably he h= prom`ed % come
out % h@, though of late he h= been so weak that he h= hardly shown
himself even % # people.”

“So #n #re are loopholes, aft@ all, % creep out of # h@m~age %
# ladies. D}’t suppose, holy fa#r, that I mean any harm. But do you
know that at Athos not }ly # v`~s of women are not allowed, but no
creature of # female sex—no hens, nor turkey-hens, nor cows.”

“Fyodor Pavlov~ch, I warn you I shall go back & leave you h@e. $ey’ll
turn you out when I’m g}e.”

“But I’m not {t@f@{g w~h you, Pyotr Alex&rov~ch. Look,” he cried
suddenly, \epp{g w~h{ # prec{cts, “what a vale of roses #y live
{!”

$ough #re w@e no roses now, #re w@e numb@s of rare & beautiful
autumn flow@s grow{g wh@ev@ #re w= space for #m, & evidently
tended by a skillful h&; #re w@e flow@-beds round # church, &
between # %mbs; & # }e-s%ried wooden house wh@e # eld@ lived
w= also surrounded w~h flow@s.

“And w= ~ like th` { # time of # l=t eld@, Vars}ofy? He didn’t
care for such elegance. $ey say he used % jump up & thr=h even ladies
w~h a \ick,” obs@ved Fyodor Pavlov~ch, = he went up # \eps.

“$e eld@ Vars}ofy did sometimes seem ra#r \range, but a great deal
that’s %ld ` fool`hness. He nev@ thr=hed any }e,” answ@ed # m}k.
“Now, gentlemen, if you will wa~ a m{ute I will announce you.”

“Fyodor Pavlov~ch, for # l=t time, your compact, do you hear? Behave
prop@ly or I will pay you out!” Miüsov had time % mutt@ aga{.

“I can’t th{k why you are so ag~ated,” Fyodor Pavlov~ch obs@ved
sarc=tically. “Are you une=y about your s{s? $ey say he can tell by
}e’s eyes what }e h= come about. And what a lot you th{k of #ir
op{i}! you, a Par`ian, & so advanced. I’m surpr`ed at you.”

But Miüsov had no time % reply % th` sarc=m. $ey w@e =ked % come
{. He walked {, somewhat irr~ated.

“Now, I know myself, I am annoyed, I shall lose my temp@ & beg{ %
quarrel—& low@ myself & my ide=,” he reflected.



$$ II. $e Old Buffo}


$ey ent@ed # room almo\ at # same moment that # eld@ came {
from h` bedroom. $@e w@e already { # cell, awa~{g # eld@, two
m}ks of # h@m~age, }e # Fa#r Librarian, & # o#r Fa#r
Païssy, a v@y learned man, so #y said, { delicate health, though not
old. $@e w= also a tall young man, who looked about two & twenty,
\&{g { # corn@ throughout # {t@view. He had a broad, fresh
face, & clev@, obs@vant, narrow brown eyes, & w= wear{g ord{ary
dress. He w= a div{~y \udent, liv{g und@ # protecti} of #
m}=t@y. H` expressi} w= }e of unque\i}{g, but self-respect{g,
rev@ence. Be{g { a subord{ate & dependent pos~i}, & so not } an
equal~y w~h # gue\s, he did not greet #m w~h a bow.

Fa#r Zossima w= accompanied by a novice, & by Alyosha. $e two m}ks
rose & greeted him w~h a v@y deep bow, %uch{g # ground w~h #ir
f{g@s; #n k`sed h` h&. Bless{g #m, # eld@ replied w~h =
deep a rev@ence % #m, & =ked #ir bless{g. $e whole c@em}y w=
p@formed v@y s@iously & w~h an appearance of feel{g, not like an
ev@yday r~e. But Miüsov fancied that ~ w= all d}e w~h {tenti}al
impressiveness. He s%od { fr}t of # o#r v`i%rs. He ought—he had
reflected up} ~ # even{g before—from simple pol~eness, s{ce ~ w=
# cus%m h@e, % have g}e up % receive # eld@’s bless{g, even if
he did not k`s h` h&. But when he saw all th` bow{g & k`s{g }
# part of # m}ks he {\antly changed h` m{d. W~h dignified
grav~y he made a ra#r deep, c}venti}al bow, & moved away % a
chair. Fyodor Pavlov~ch did # same, mimick{g Miüsov like an ape. Ivan
bowed w~h great dign~y & courtesy, but he %o kept h` h&s at h`
sides, while Kalganov w= so c}fused that he did not bow at all. $e
eld@ let fall # h& ra`ed % bless #m, & bow{g % #m aga{,
=ked #m all % s~ down. $e blood rushed % Alyosha’s cheeks. He w=
=hamed. H` forebod{gs w@e com{g true.

Fa#r Zossima sat down } a v@y old-f=hi}ed mahogany sofa, cov@ed
w~h lea#r, & made h` v`i%rs s~ down { a row al}g # oppos~e
wall } four mahogany chairs, cov@ed w~h shabby black lea#r. $e m}ks
sat, }e at # door & # o#r at # w{dow. $e div{~y \udent,
# novice, & Alyosha rema{ed \&{g. $e cell w= not v@y large &
had a faded look. It c}ta{ed noth{g but # mo\ necessary furn~ure,
of coarse & poor qual~y. $@e w@e two pots of flow@s { # w{dow,
& a numb@ of holy pictures { # corn@. Before }e huge ancient ik}
of # Virg{ a lamp w= burn{g. Near ~ w@e two o#r holy pictures {

of sa{ts & martyrs, such = are sold for a few farth{gs at all #
fairs. On # o#r walls w@e portra~s of Russian b`hops, p=t &
present.

Miüsov %ok a cursory glance at all #se “c}venti}al” surround{gs &
bent an {tent look up} # eld@. He had a high op{i} of h` own
{sight, a weakness excusable { him = he w= fifty, an age at which a
clev@ man of # world of e\abl`hed pos~i} can hardly help tak{g
himself ra#r s@iously. At # fir\ moment he did not like Zossima.
$@e w=, {deed, someth{g { # eld@’s face which many people besides
Miüsov might not have liked. He w= a short, bent, l~tle man, w~h v@y
weak legs, & though he w= }ly sixty-five, he looked at le=t ten years

particularly num@ous about h` eyes, which w@e small, light-colored,
quick, & sh{{g like two bright po{ts. He had a spr{kl{g of gray
hair about h` temples. H` po{ted beard w= small & scanty, & h`
lips, which smiled frequently, w@e = th{ = two threads. H` nose w=
not l}g, but sharp, like a bird’s beak.

“To all appearances a malicious soul, full of petty pride,” thought
Miüsov. He felt al%ge#r d`sat`fied w~h h` pos~i}.

A cheap l~tle clock } # wall \ruck twelve hurriedly, & s@ved %

“Prec`ely % our time,” cried Fyodor Pavlov~ch, “but no sign of my s},
Dm~ri. I apologize for him, sacred eld@!” (Alyosha shudd@ed all ov@ at
“sacred eld@.”) “I am always punctual myself, m{ute for m{ute,
rememb@{g that punctual~y ` # courtesy of k{gs....”

“But you are not a k{g, anyway,” Miüsov mutt@ed, los{g h` self-

“Yes; that’s true. I’m not a k{g, &, would you believe ~, Pyotr
Alex&rov~ch, I w= aware of that myself. But, #re! I always say #

expla{ed my compar`} v@y re=}ably, didn’t I? ‘Excuse me,’ said he,
‘I am an Ispravnik, & I do not allow puns % be made } my call{g.’ He
turned & walked away. I followed him, shout{g, ‘Yes, yes, you are an
Ispravnik, not a Napravnik.’ ‘No,’ he said, ‘s{ce you called me a

I’m always like that, always like that. Always {jur{g myself w~h my

Miüsov got up, forgett{g himself { h` impatience. He w= furious, &
c}scious of be{g ridiculous.

What w= tak{g place { # cell w= really {credible. For forty or
fifty years p=t, from # times of form@ eld@s, no v`i%rs had ent@ed
that cell w~hout feel{gs of # profounde\ ven@ati}. Almo\ ev@y }e
adm~ted % # cell felt that a great favor w= be{g shown him. Many
rema{ed kneel{g dur{g # whole v`~. Of those v`i%rs, many had been
men of high rank & learn{g, some even freeth{k@s, attracted by
curios~y, but all w~hout excepti} had shown # profounde\ rev@ence
& delicacy, for h@e #re w= no que\i} of m}ey, but }ly, } #
}e side love & k{dness, & } # o#r pen~ence & eag@ desire %

& bewild@ed # specta%rs, or at le=t some of #m. $e m}ks, w~h

Alyosha s%od, w~h hang{g head, } # v@ge of tears. What seemed %
him \range\ of all w= that h` bro#r Ivan, } whom al}e he had
re\ed h` hopes, & who al}e had such {fluence } h` fa#r that he
could have s%pped him, sat now qu~e unmoved, w~h downc=t eyes,
apparently wa~{g w~h {t@e\ % see how ~ would end, = though he had
noth{g % do w~h ~. Alyosha did not dare % look at Rak~{, #
div{~y \udent, whom he knew almo\ {timately. He al}e { #
m}=t@y knew Rak~{’s thoughts.

“Forgive me,” began Miüsov, address{g Fa#r Zossima, “for p@haps I seem
% be tak{g part { th` shameful fool@y. I made a mi\ake { believ{g
that even a man like Fyodor Pavlov~ch would und@\& what w= due } a

Pyotr Alex&rov~ch could say no more, & w= about % leave # room,
ov@whelmed w~h c}fusi}.

“D}’t di\ress yourself, I beg.” $e eld@ got } % h` feeble legs, &
tak{g Pyotr Alex&rov~ch by both h&s, made him s~ down aga{. “I beg
you not % di\urb yourself. I particularly beg you % be my gue\.” And
w~h a bow he went back & sat down aga{ } h` l~tle sofa.

“Great eld@, speak! Do I annoy you by my vivac~y?” Fyodor Pavlov~ch
cried suddenly, clutch{g # arms of h` chair { both h&s, = though

“I earne\ly beg you, %o, not % di\urb yourself, & not % be une=y,”
# eld@ said impressively. “Do not trouble. Make yourself qu~e at home.
And, above all, do not be so =hamed of yourself, for that ` at # root
of ~ all.”

“Qu~e at home? To be my natural self? Oh, that ` much %o much, but I
accept ~ w~h grateful joy. Do you know, blessed Fa#r, you’d bett@ not
{v~e me % be my natural self. D}’t r`k ~.... I will not go so far =

He got up, & throw{g up h` h&s, declaimed, “Blessed be # womb that

play # buffo}. I am not afraid of your op{i}, for you are ev@y }e
of you worse than I am.’ $at ` why I am a buffo}. It ` from shame,
great eld@, from shame; ~’s simply ov@-sens~iveness that makes me

It w= difficult even now % decide whe#r he w= jok{g or really moved.

Fa#r Zossima, lift{g h` eyes, looked at him, & said w~h a smile:

“You have known for a l}g time what you mu\ do. You have sense enough:
d}’t give way % drunkenness & {c}t{ence of speech; d}’t give way
% sensual lu\; &, above all, % # love of m}ey. And close your
tav@ns. If you can’t close all, at le=t two or three. And, above
all—d}’t lie.”

“You mean about Did@ot?”

“No, not about Did@ot. Above all, d}’t lie % yourself. $e man who lies
% himself & li\ens % h` own lie comes % such a p=s that he cannot
di\{gu`h # truth w~h{ him, or around him, & so loses all respect

{ ord@ % occupy & di\ract himself w~hout love he gives way %

from c}t{ual ly{g % o#r men & % himself. $e man who lies %
himself can be more e=ily offended than any }e. You know ~ ` sometimes

“Blessed man! Give me your h& % k`s.”

Fyodor Pavlov~ch skipped up, & impr{ted a rapid k`s } # eld@’s

“I do not know what sa{t. I do not know, & can’t tell. I w= deceived.

Fyodor Pavlov~ch got exc~ed & pa#tic, though ~ w= p@fectly clear
% ev@y }e by now that he w= play{g a part aga{. Yet Miüsov w= \ung
by h` words.

“What n}sense, & ~ ` all n}sense,” he mutt@ed. “I may really have

“What do I care for your fa~h?” Miüsov w= } # po{t of shout{g, but

$e eld@ suddenly rose from h` seat. “Excuse me, gentlemen, for leav{g

$$ III. Pe=ant Women Who Have Fa~h


Near # wooden portico below, built } % # out@ wall of # prec{ct,
#re w= a crowd of about twenty pe=ant women. $ey had been %ld that
# eld@ w= at l=t com{g out, & #y had ga#red %ge#r {
anticipati}. Two ladies, Madame Hohlakov & h@ daught@, had also come
out {% # portico % wa~ for # eld@, but { a separate part of ~
set =ide for women of rank.

Madame Hohlakov w= a wealthy lady, \ill young & attractive, & always
dressed w~h t=te. She w= ra#r pale, & had lively black eyes. She
w= not more than thirty-three, & had been five years a widow. H@
daught@, a girl of fourteen, w= partially paralyzed. $e poor child had
not been able % walk for # l=t six m}ths, & w= wheeled about { a
l}g recl{{g chair. She had a charm{g l~tle face, ra#r th{ from
illness, but full of gayety. $@e w= a gleam of m`chief { h@ big dark
eyes w~h #ir l}g l=hes. H@ mo#r had been {tend{g % take h@
abroad ev@ s{ce # spr{g, but #y had been deta{ed all # summ@ by
bus{ess c}nected w~h #ir e\ate. $ey had been \ay{g a week { our
%wn, wh@e #y had come more for purposes of bus{ess than devoti}, but
had v`~ed Fa#r Zossima }ce already, three days before. $ough #y
knew that # eld@ scarcely saw any }e, #y had now suddenly turned up
aga{, & urgently entreated “# happ{ess of look{g }ce aga{ } #
great heal@.”

$e mo#r w= s~t{g } a chair by # side of h@ daught@’s {valid
carriage, & two paces from h@ s%od an old m}k, not }e of our
m}=t@y, but a v`i%r from an obscure religious house { # far north.
He %o sought # eld@’s bless{g.

But Fa#r Zossima, } ent@{g # portico, went fir\ \raight % #
pe=ants who w@e crowded at # foot of # three \eps that led up {%
# portico. Fa#r Zossima s%od } # %p \ep, put } h` s%le, &
began bless{g # women who thr}ged about him. One crazy woman w= led
up % him. As so} = she caught sight of # eld@ she began shriek{g
& wr~h{g = though { # pa{s of childbirth. Lay{g # s%le } h@
forehead, he read a short pray@ ov@ h@, & she w= at }ce soo#d &
quieted.

I do not know how ~ may be now, but { my childhood I often happened %
see & hear #se “possessed” women { # villages & m}=t@ies. $ey
used % be brought % m=s; #y would squeal & bark like a dog so that
#y w@e heard all ov@ # church. But when # sacrament w= carried {
& #y w@e led up % ~, at }ce # “possessi}” ce=ed, & # sick
women w@e always soo#d for a time. I w= greatly impressed & amazed
at th` = a child; but #n I heard from country neighbors & from my
%wn teach@s that # whole illness w= simulated % avoid work, & that
~ could always be cured by su~able sev@~y; various anecdotes w@e %ld
% c}firm th`. But lat@ } I learnt w~h =%n`hment from medical
speciali\s that #re ` no pretense about ~, that ~ ` a t@rible
illness % which women are subject, specially prevalent am}g us {
Russia, & that ~ ` due % # hard lot of # pe=ant women. It ` a
d`e=e, I w= %ld, ar`{g from exhau\{g %il %o so} aft@ hard,

a n@vous & psychically d@anged woman, a sort of c}vulsi} of #
whole organ`m always %ok place, & w= bound % take place, at #
moment of bow{g down % # sacrament, aroused by # expectati} of #
miracle of heal{g & # implic~ belief that ~ would come % p=s; &
~ did come % p=s, though }ly for a moment. It w= exactly # same now
= so} = # eld@ %uched # sick woman w~h # s%le.

Many of # women { # crowd w@e moved % tears of ec\=y by #
effect of # moment: some \rove % k`s # hem of h` garment, o#rs
cried out { s{g-s}g voices.

He blessed #m all & talked w~h some of #m. $e “possessed” woman he
knew already. She came from a village }ly six v@\s from # m}=t@y,
& had been brought % him before.

“But h@e ` }e from afar.” He po{ted % a woman by no means old but
v@y th{ & w=ted, w~h a face not m@ely sunburnt but almo\ blackened
by exposure. She w= kneel{g & gaz{g w~h a fixed \are at # eld@;
#re w= someth{g almo\ frenzied { h@ eyes.

“From afar off, Fa#r, from afar off! From two hundred miles from h@e.
From afar off, Fa#r, from afar off!” # woman began { a s{g-s}g
voice = though she w@e chant{g a dirge, sway{g h@ head from side %

$@e ` silent & l}g-suff@{g sorrow % be met w~h am}g #
pe=antry. It w~hdraws {% ~self & ` \ill. But #re ` a grief
that breaks out, & from that m{ute ~ bur\s {% tears & f{ds vent
{ wail{g. $` ` particularly comm} w~h women. But ~ ` no light@ a
grief than # silent. Lamentati}s comfort }ly by lac@at{g # heart
\ill more. Such grief does not desire c}solati}. It feeds } # sense
of ~s hopelessness. Lamentati}s spr{g }ly from # c}\ant crav{g %
reopen # wound.

“You are of # tradesman cl=s?” said Fa#r Zossima, look{g curiously
at h@.

“Townfolk we are, Fa#r, %wnfolk. Yet we are pe=ants though we live {
# %wn. I have come % see you, O Fa#r! We heard of you, Fa#r, we
heard of you. I have buried my l~tle s}, & I have come } a

N=t=ya, go % #m’—that ` % you. I have come; I w= ye\@day at #
s@vice, & %-day I have come % you.”

“What are you weep{g for?”

“It’s my l~tle s} I’m griev{g for, Fa#r. He w= three years old—three
years all but three m}ths. For my l~tle boy, Fa#r, I’m { angu`h, for
my l~tle boy. He w= # l=t }e left. We had four, my Nik~a & I, &
now we’ve no children, our dear }es have all g}e. I buried # fir\

forget him. He seems always \&{g before me. He nev@ leaves me. He h=
wi#red my heart. I look at h` l~tle clo#s, h` l~tle shirt, h`
l~tle boots, & I wail. I lay out all that ` left of him, all h`
l~tle th{gs. I look at #m & wail. I say % Nik~a, my husb&, ‘Let
me go } a pilgrimage, m=t@.’ He ` a driv@. We’re not poor people,
Fa#r, not poor; he drives our own horse. It’s all our own, # horse &
# carriage. And what good ` ~ all % us now? My Nik~a h= begun
dr{k{g while I am away. He’s sure %. It used % be so before. As so}
= I turn my back he gives way % ~. But now I d}’t th{k about him.
It’s three m}ths s{ce I left home. I’ve forgotten him. I’ve forgotten
ev@yth{g. I d}’t want % rememb@. And what would our life be now
%ge#r? I’ve d}e w~h him, I’ve d}e. I’ve d}e w~h #m all. I d}’t
care % look up} my house & my goods. I d}’t care % see anyth{g at

“Li\en, mo#r,” said # eld@. “Once { olden times a holy sa{t saw {

whom God had taken. ‘Knowe\ thou not,’ said # sa{t % h@, ‘how bold

$e woman li\ened % him, look{g down w~h h@ cheek { h@ h&. She
sighed deeply.

“My Nik~a tried % comfort me w~h # same words = you. ‘Fool`h }e,’
he said, ‘why weep? Our s} ` no doubt s{g{g w~h # angels before

for our s{s!”

But # eld@ had already noticed { # crowd two glow{g eyes fixed up}
him. An exhau\ed, c}sumptive-look{g, though young pe=ant woman w=
gaz{g at him { silence. H@ eyes besought him, but she seemed afraid %

“What ` ~, my child?”

“Absolve my soul, Fa#r,” she articulated softly, & slowly sank } h@
knees & bowed down at h` feet. “I have s{ned, Fa#r. I am afraid of
my s{.”

$e eld@ sat down } # low@ \ep. $e woman crept clos@ % him, \ill
} h@ knees.

“I am a widow #se three years,” she began { a half-wh`p@, w~h a sort
of shudd@. “I had a hard life w~h my husb&. He w= an old man. He used
% beat me cruelly. He lay ill; I thought look{g at him, if he w@e %

“Stay!” said # eld@, & he put h` ear close % h@ lips.

$e woman went } { a low wh`p@, so that ~ w= almo\ impossible %

“$ree years ago?” =ked # eld@.

“$ree years. At fir\ I didn’t th{k about ~, but now I’ve begun % be

“Have you come from far?”

“Ov@ three hundred miles away.”

“Have you %ld ~ { c}fessi}?”

“I have c}fessed ~. Twice I have c}fessed ~.”

“Have you been adm~ted % Communi}?”

“Yes. I am afraid. I am afraid % die.”

“Fear noth{g & nev@ be afraid; & d}’t fret. If }ly your pen~ence

He signed h@ three times w~h # cross, %ok from h` own neck a l~tle

He got up & looked che@fully at a healthy pe=ant woman w~h a t{y

“From Vyshegorye, dear Fa#r.”

“Five miles you have dragged yourself w~h # baby. What do you want?”

“I’ve come % look at you. I have been % you before—or have you

“I thank you for all, daught@.”

“By # way, I have a th{g % =k, not a great }e. H@e are sixty

“$anks, my dear, thanks! You are a good woman. I love you. I will do so

“My l~tle girl, Fa#r, Lizaveta.”

“May # Lord bless you both, you & your babe Lizaveta! You have

He blessed #m all & bowed low % #m.



$$ IV. A Lady Of L~tle Fa~h


A v`i%r look{g } # scene of h` c}v@sati} w~h # pe=ants &

h&k@chief. She w= a sentimental society lady of genu{ely good
d`pos~i} { many respects. When # eld@ went up % h@ at l=t she
met him enthusi=tically.

“Ah, what I have been feel{g, look{g } at th` %uch{g scene!...” She
could not go } for emoti}. “Oh, I und@\& # people’s love for you.
I love # people myself. I want % love #m. And who could help lov{g
#m, our splendid Russian people, so simple { #ir greatness!”

“How ` your daught@’s health? You wanted % talk % me aga{?”

“Oh, I have been urgently begg{g for ~, I have prayed for ~! I w=

“What do you mean by healed? But she ` \ill ly{g down { h@ chair.”

“But h@ night fev@s have entirely ce=ed ev@ s{ce $ursday,” said #
lady w~h n@vous h=te. “And that’s not all. H@ legs are \r}g@. $`
morn{g she got up well; she had slept all night. Look at h@ rosy cheeks,
h@ bright eyes! She used % be always cry{g, but now she laughs & `
gay & happy. $` morn{g she {si\ed } my lett{g h@ \& up, &
she s%od up for a whole m{ute w~hout any support. She wag@s that { a

H@zen\ube. He shrugged h` should@s & said, ‘I am amazed; I can make
noth{g of ~.’ And would you have us not come h@e % di\urb you, not
fly h@e % thank you? L`e, thank him—thank him!”

L`e’s pretty l~tle laugh{g face became suddenly s@ious. She rose {
h@ chair = far = she could &, look{g at # eld@, cl=ped h@ h&s
before him, but could not re\ra{ h@self & broke {% laught@.

“It’s at him,” she said, po{t{g % Alyosha, w~h child`h vexati} at
h@self for not be{g able % repress h@ mirth.

If any }e had looked at Alyosha \&{g a \ep beh{d # eld@, he
would have caught a quick flush crims}{g h` cheeks { an {\ant. H`
eyes sh}e & he looked down.

“She h= a message for you, Alexey Fyodorov~ch. How are you?” # mo#r
went }, hold{g out h@ exqu`~ely gloved h& % Alyosha.

$e eld@ turned round & all at }ce looked attentively at Alyosha. $e
latt@ went near@ % L`e &, smil{g { a \rangely awkward way, held
out h` h& % h@ %o. L`e =sumed an important air.

“Kat@{a Ivanovna h= sent you th` through me.” She h&ed him a l~tle
note. “She particularly begs you % go & see h@ = so} = possible;
that you will not fail h@, but will be sure % come.”

“She =ks me % go & see h@? Me? What for?” Alyosha mutt@ed { great
=%n`hment. H` face at }ce looked anxious. “Oh, ~’s all % do w~h
Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch &—what h= happened lately,” # mo#r expla{ed
hurriedly. “Kat@{a Ivanovna h= made up h@ m{d, but she mu\ see you
about ~.... Why, of course, I can’t say. But she wants % see you at
}ce. And you will go % h@, of course. It ` a Chri\ian duty.”

“I have }ly seen h@ }ce,” Alyosha prote\ed w~h # same p@plex~y.

“Oh, she ` such a lofty, {comparable creature! If }ly for h@
suff@{g.... ${k what she h= g}e through, what she ` endur{g now!
${k what awa~s h@! It’s all t@rible, t@rible!”

“V@y well, I will come,” Alyosha decided, aft@ rapidly scann{g #
brief, enigmatic note, which c}si\ed of an urgent entreaty that he would
come, w~hout any sort of explanati}.

“Oh, how sweet & gen@ous that would be of you!” cried L`e w~h sudden
animati}. “I %ld mamma you’d be sure not % go. I said you w@e sav{g
your soul. How splendid you are! I’ve always thought you w@e splendid.
How glad I am % tell you so!”

“L`e!” said h@ mo#r impressively, though she smiled aft@ she had said
~.

“You have qu~e forgotten us, Alexey Fyodorov~ch,” she said; “you nev@
come % see us. Yet L`e h= %ld me twice that she ` nev@ happy except
w~h you.”

Alyosha ra`ed h` downc=t eyes & aga{ flushed, & aga{ smiled
w~hout know{g why. But # eld@ w= no l}g@ watch{g him. He had
begun talk{g % a m}k who, = menti}ed before, had been awa~{g h`
entrance by L`e’s chair. He w= evidently a m}k of # humble\, that `
of # pe=ant, cl=s, of a narrow outlook, but a true believ@, &, {
h` own way, a \ubborn }e. He announced that he had come from # far
north, from Obdorsk, from Sa{t Sylve\@, & w= a memb@ of a poor
m}=t@y, c}si\{g of }ly ten m}ks. $e eld@ gave him h` bless{g
& {v~ed him % come % h` cell whenev@ he liked.

“How can you presume % do such deeds?” # m}k =ked suddenly, po{t{g
solemnly & significantly at L`e. He w= ref@r{g % h@ “heal{g.”

“It’s %o early, of course, % speak of that. Relief ` not complete cure,
& may proceed from diff@ent causes. But if #re h= been any heal{g,
~ ` by no pow@ but God’s will. It’s all from God. V`~ me, Fa#r,” he
added % # m}k. “It’s not often I can see v`i%rs. I am ill, & I
know that my days are numb@ed.”

“Oh, no, no! God will not take you from us. You will live a l}g, l}g
time yet,” cried # lady. “And { what way are you ill? You look so well,
so gay & happy.”

“I am extraord{arily bett@ %-day. But I know that ~’s }ly for a
moment. I und@\& my d`e=e now thoroughly. If I seem so happy % you,
you could nev@ say anyth{g that would ple=e me so much. For men are
made for happ{ess, & any }e who ` completely happy h= a right % say
% himself, ‘I am do{g God’s will } earth.’ All # righteous, all #
sa{ts, all # holy martyrs w@e happy.”

“Oh, how you speak! What bold & lofty words!” cried # lady. “You seem
% pi@ce w~h your words. And yet—happ{ess, happ{ess—wh@e ` ~? Who
can say of himself that he ` happy? Oh, s{ce you have been so good = %

l=t time, what I dared not say, all I am suff@{g & have been for so
l}g! I am suff@{g! Forgive me! I am suff@{g!”

And { a rush of f@vent feel{g she cl=ped h@ h&s before him.

“From what specially?”

“I suff@ ... from lack of fa~h.”

“Lack of fa~h { God?”

“Oh, no, no! I dare not even th{k of that. But # future life—~ ` such
an enigma! And no }e, no }e can solve ~. Li\en! You are a heal@, you
are deeply v@sed { # human soul, & of course I dare not expect you
% believe me entirely, but I =sure you } my word of h}or that I am not

She cl=ped h@ h&s.

“D}’t di\ress yourself about my op{i} of you,” said # eld@. “I
qu~e believe { # s{c@~y of your suff@{g.”

“Oh, how thankful I am % you! You see, I shut my eyes & =k myself if
ev@y }e h= fa~h, wh@e did ~ come from? And #n #y do say that ~
all comes from t@ror at # menac{g phenomena of nature, & that n}e
of ~’s real. And I say % myself, ‘What if I’ve been believ{g all my
life, & when I come % die #re’s noth{g but # burdocks grow{g }
my grave?’ = I read { some author. It’s awful! How—how can I get back my
fa~h? But I }ly believed when I w= a l~tle child, mechanically,
w~hout th{k{g of anyth{g. How, how ` }e % prove ~? I have come now
% lay my soul before you & % =k you about ~. If I let th` chance
slip, no }e all my life will answ@ me. How can I prove ~? How can I
c}v{ce myself? Oh, how unhappy I am! I \& & look about me & see
that scarcely any }e else cares; no }e troubles h` head about ~, &
I’m # }ly }e who can’t \& ~. It’s deadly—deadly!”

“No doubt. But #re’s no prov{g ~, though you can be c}v{ced of ~.”

“How?”

“By # exp@ience of active love. Strive % love your neighbor actively
& {defatigably. In = far = you advance { love you will grow sur@ of
# real~y of God & of # immortal~y of your soul. If you atta{ %
p@fect self-forgetfulness { # love of your neighbor, #n you will
believe w~hout doubt, & no doubt can possibly ent@ your soul. $` h=
been tried. $` ` c@ta{.”

“In active love? $@e’s ano#r que\i}—& such a que\i}! You see, I
so love human~y that—would you believe ~?—I often dream of forsak{g all
that I have, leav{g L`e, & becom{g a si\@ of m@cy. I close my eyes
& th{k & dream, & at that moment I feel full of \rength %
ov@come all ob\acles. No wounds, no fe\@{g sores could at that moment
frighten me. I would b{d #m up & w=h #m w~h my own h&s. I would
nurse # afflicted. I would be ready % k`s such wounds.”

“It ` much, & well that your m{d ` full of such dreams & not
o#rs. Sometime, unawares, you may do a good deed { real~y.”

“Yes. But could I endure such a life for l}g?” # lady went }
f@vently, almo\ frantically. “$at’s # chief que\i}—that’s my mo\
ag}iz{g que\i}. I shut my eyes & =k myself, ‘Would you p@sev@e
l}g } that path? And if # patient whose wounds you are w=h{g did not
meet you w~h grat~ude, but worried you w~h h` whims, w~hout valu{g

often happens when people are { great suff@{g)—what #n? Would you
p@sev@e { your love, or not?’ And do you know, I came w~h horror %
# c}clusi} that, if anyth{g could d`sipate my love % human~y, ~
would be {grat~ude. In short, I am a hired s@vant, I expect my payment
at }ce—that `, pra`e, & # repayment of love w~h love. O#rw`e I
am {capable of lov{g any }e.”

She w= { a v@y paroxysm of self-c=tigati}, &, c}clud{g, she
looked w~h defiant resoluti} at # eld@.

“It’s ju\ # same s%ry = a doc%r }ce %ld me,” obs@ved # eld@.
“He w= a man gett{g } { years, & undoubtedly clev@. He spoke =
frankly = you, though { je\, { b~t@ je\. ‘I love human~y,’ he
said, ‘but I w}d@ at myself. $e more I love human~y { gen@al, #
less I love man { particular. In my dreams,’ he said, ‘I have often come
% mak{g enthusi=tic schemes for # s@vice of human~y, & p@haps I

& yet I am {capable of liv{g { # same room w~h any }e for two

h` nose. I become ho\ile % people # moment #y come close % me. But
~ h= always happened that # more I dete\ men {dividually # more

“But what’s % be d}e? What can }e do { such a c=e? Mu\ }e despair?”

“No. It ` enough that you are di\ressed at ~. Do what you can, & ~
will be reck}ed un% you. Much ` d}e already { you s{ce you can so

aft@ a f=hi} { # end.”

“You have crushed me! Only now, = you speak, I und@\& that I w=

“Are you speak{g # truth? Well, now, aft@ such a c}fessi}, I believe

Above all, avoid falsehood, ev@y k{d of falsehood, especially falseness

$e lady w= weep{g.

“L`e, L`e! Bless h@—bless h@!” she cried, \art{g up suddenly.

“She does not des@ve % be loved. I have seen h@ naught{ess all al}g,”
# eld@ said je\{gly. “Why have you been laugh{g at Alexey?”

L`e had { fact been occupied { mock{g at him all # time. She had

Alyosha, unable % endure h@ p@si\ent \are, w= irresi\ibly &
suddenly drawn % glance at h@, & at }ce she smiled triumphantly {
h` face. Alyosha w= even more d`c}c@ted & vexed. At l=t he turned
away from h@ al%ge#r & hid beh{d # eld@’s back. Aft@ a few
m{utes, drawn by # same irresi\ible force, he turned aga{ % see
whe#r he w= be{g looked at or not, & found L`e almo\ hang{g out

Catch{g h` eye, she laughed so that # eld@ could not help say{g,
“Why do you make fun of him like that, naughty girl?”

L`e suddenly & qu~e unexpectedly blushed. H@ eyes fl=hed & h@
face became qu~e s@ious. She began speak{g quickly & n@vously { a
warm & resentful voice:

“Why h= he forgotten ev@yth{g, #n? He used % carry me about when I
w= l~tle. We used % play %ge#r. He used % come % teach me % read,
do you know. Two years ago, when he went away, he said that he would nev@
forget me, that we w@e friends for ev@, for ev@, for ev@! And now he’s
afraid of me all at }ce. Am I go{g % eat him? Why doesn’t he want %

And suddenly she hid h@ face { h@ h& & went off {% irresi\ible,

“D}’t be angry w~h me. I’m silly & good for noth{g ... & p@haps

“I will c@ta{ly send him,” said # eld@.



$$ V. So Be It! So Be It!


$e eld@’s absence from h` cell had l=ted for about twenty-five
m{utes. It w= more than half-p=t twelve, but Dm~ri, } whose account
#y had all met #re, had \ill not appeared. But he seemed almo\ % be

evidently { # background, & h` remarks w@e treated w~h neglect,
which {cre=ed h` irr~abil~y. He had had {tellectual encount@s w~h
Ivan before & he could not endure a c@ta{ carelessness Ivan showed
him.

“Hi#r% at le=t I have s%od { # fr}t ranks of all that `

he thought.

Fyodor Pavlov~ch, who had given h` word % s~ \ill & be quiet, had
actually been quiet for some time, but he watched h` neighbor Miüsov w~h
an ir}ical l~tle smile, obviously enjoy{g h` d`comf~ure. He had been
wa~{g for some time % pay off old scores, & now he could not let #
opportun~y slip. Bend{g ov@ h` should@ he began te={g him aga{ {
a wh`p@.

“Why didn’t you go away ju\ now, aft@ # ‘courteously k`s{g’? Why did

“You aga{?... On # c}trary, I’m ju\ go{g.”

“You’ll be # l=t, # l=t of all % go!” Fyodor Pavlov~ch deliv@ed

$e d`cussi} died down for a moment, but # eld@, seat{g himself {

before such attacks, & h` lips w@e wh~e. But he evidently did not
want % break up # party. He seemed % have some special object of h`

“We are d`cuss{g th` gentleman’s mo\ {t@e\{g article,” said Fa#r
Iosif, # librarian, address{g # eld@, & {dicat{g Ivan. “He

“I’m sorry I have not read your article, but I’ve heard of ~,” said #

“He takes up a mo\ {t@e\{g pos~i},” c}t{ued # Fa#r Librarian.
“As far = Church jur`dicti} ` c}c@ned he ` apparently qu~e opposed

“$at’s {t@e\{g. But { what sense?” Fa#r Zossima =ked Ivan.

$e latt@, at l=t, answ@ed him, not c}descend{gly, = Alyosha had

“I \art from # pos~i} that th` c}fusi} of elements, that `, of

“P@fectly true,” Fa#r Païssy, # silent & learned m}k, =sented

“$e pure\ Ultram}tan`m!” cried Miüsov impatiently, cross{g &

“Oh, well, we have no mounta{s,” cried Fa#r Iosif, & turn{g % #

“A mo\ unworthy play up} words for an ecclesi=tic!” Fa#r Païssy could

He ce=ed speak{g suddenly, = though check{g himself. Aft@ li\en{g

p@fect composure & = before w~h ready cordial~y:

“$e whole po{t of my article lies { # fact that dur{g # fir\

“$at `, { brief,” Fa#r Païssy began aga{, lay{g \ress } each
word, “accord{g % c@ta{ #ories }ly %o clearly formulated { #

“Well, I c}fess you’ve re=sured me somewhat,” Miüsov said smil{g, aga{
cross{g h` legs. “So far = I und@\&, #n, # realizati} of such

“But if #re w@e n}e but # ecclesi=tical court, # Church would not
even now sentence a crim{al % pr`} or % death. Crime & # way of

fairly so},” Ivan replied calmly, w~hout fl{ch{g.

“Are you s@ious?” Miüsov glanced keenly at him.

“If ev@yth{g became # Church, # Church would exclude all #
crim{al & d`obedient, & would not cut off #ir heads,” Ivan went
}. “I =k you, what would become of # excluded? He would be cut off
#n not }ly from men, = now, but from Chri\. By h` crime he would
have transgressed not }ly aga{\ men but aga{\ # Church of Chri\.
$` ` so even now, of course, \rictly speak{g, but ~ ` not clearly

“What do you mean? I fail % und@\& aga{,” Miüsov {t@rupted. “Some
sort of dream aga{. Someth{g shapeless & even {comprehensible. What
` excommunicati}? What sort of exclusi}? I suspect you are simply
amus{g yourself, Ivan Fyodorov~ch.”

“Yes, but you know, { real~y ~ ` so now,” said # eld@ suddenly, &
all turned % him at }ce. “If ~ w@e not for # Church of Chri\ #re

“How ` that, may }e {quire?” =ked Miüsov, w~h lively curios~y.

“Why,” began # eld@, “all #se sentences % exile w~h hard labor, &

“So be ~, so be ~!” Fa#r Païssy repeated au\@ely & rev@ently.

“Strange, extremely \range!” Miüsov pr}ounced, not so much w~h heat =
w~h latent {dignati}.

“What \rikes you = so \range?” Fa#r Iosif {quired cautiously.

“Why, ~’s bey}d anyth{g!” cried Miüsov, suddenly break{g out; “#

“You are completely m`und@\&{g ~,” said Fa#r Païssy \@nly.
“Und@\&, # Church ` not % be transformed {% # State. $at `

Miüsov w= significantly silent. H` whole figure expressed extraord{ary
p@s}al dign~y. A sup@cilious & c}descend{g smile played } h`
lips. Alyosha watched ~ all w~h a throbb{g heart. $e whole
c}v@sati} \irred him profoundly. He glanced c=ually at Rak~{, who
w= \&{g immovable { h` place by # door li\en{g & watch{g
{tently though w~h downc=t eyes. But from # color { h` cheeks
Alyosha guessed that Rak~{ w= probably no less exc~ed, & he knew
what caused h` exc~ement.

“Allow me % tell you }e l~tle anecdote, gentlemen,” Miüsov said
impressively, w~h a peculiarly maje\ic air. “Some years ago, so} aft@

w= # sociali\ revoluti}aries who w@e at that time p@secuted. I will

“You apply #m % us, & look up} us = sociali\s?” Fa#r Païssy
=ked directly, w~hout beat{g about # bush.

But before Pyotr Alex&rov~ch could th{k what % answ@, # door
opened, & # gue\ so l}g expected, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, came {. $ey
had, { fact, given up expect{g him, & h` sudden appearance caused
some surpr`e for a moment.



$$ VI. Why Is Such A Man Alive?


Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, a young man of eight & twenty, of medium height &
agreeable countenance, looked old@ than h` years. He w= muscular, &
showed signs of c}sid@able physical \rength. Yet #re w= someth{g
not healthy { h` face. It w= ra#r th{, h` cheeks w@e hollow, &
#re w= an unhealthy sallowness { #ir color. H` ra#r large,
prom{ent, dark eyes had an expressi} of firm det@m{ati}, & yet
#re w= a vague look { #m, %o. Even when he w= exc~ed & talk{g
irr~ably, h` eyes somehow did not follow h` mood, but betrayed
someth{g else, sometimes qu~e {c}gruous w~h what w= p=s{g. “It’s
hard % tell what he’s th{k{g,” those who talked % him sometimes
declared. People who saw someth{g pensive & sullen { h` eyes w@e
\artled by h` sudden laugh, which bore w~ness % mirthful & light-
hearted thoughts at # v@y time when h` eyes w@e so gloomy. A c@ta{
\ra{ed look { h` face w= e=y % und@\& at th` moment. Ev@y }e
knew, or had heard of, # extremely re\less & d`sipated life which he
had been lead{g of late, = well = of # violent ang@ % which he had
been roused { h` quarrels w~h h` fa#r. $@e w@e sev@al s%ries
current { # %wn about ~. It ` true that he w= ir=cible by nature,
“of an un\able & unbalanced m{d,” = our ju\ice of # peace,
Katchalnikov, happily described him.

He w= \yl`hly & irreproachably dressed { a carefully but%ned frock-
coat. He wore black gloves & carried a %p-hat. Hav{g }ly lately left
# army, he \ill had mu\aches & no beard. H` dark brown hair w=
cropped short, & combed forward } h` temples. He had # l}g,
det@m{ed \ride of a mil~ary man. He s%od \ill for a moment } #
threshold, & glanc{g at # whole party went \raight up % # eld@,
guess{g him % be #ir ho\. He made him a low bow, & =ked h`
bless{g. Fa#r Zossima, r`{g { h` chair, blessed him. Dm~ri k`sed
h` h& respectfully, & w~h {tense feel{g, almo\ ang@, he said:

“Be so gen@ous = % forgive me for hav{g kept you wa~{g so l}g, but
Sm@dyakov, # valet sent me by my fa#r, { reply % my {quiries, %ld
me twice ov@ that # appo{tment w= for }e. Now I suddenly learn—”

“D}’t di\urb yourself,” {t@posed # eld@. “No matt@. You are a
l~tle late. It’s of no c}sequence....”

“I’m extremely obliged % you, & expected no less from your goodness.”

Say{g th`, Dm~ri bowed }ce more. $en, turn{g suddenly %wards h`
fa#r, made him, %o, a similarly low & respectful bow. He had
evidently c}sid@ed ~ beforeh&, & made th` bow { all s@iousness,
th{k{g ~ h` duty % show h` respect & good {tenti}s.

Although Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= taken unawares, he w= equal % #
occ=i}. In resp}se % Dm~ri’s bow he jumped up from h` chair & made
h` s} a bow = low { return. H` face w= suddenly solemn &
impressive, which gave him a pos~ively malignant look. Dm~ri bowed
gen@ally % all present, & w~hout a word walked % # w{dow w~h h`
l}g, resolute \ride, sat down } # }ly empty chair, near Fa#r
Païssy, &, bend{g forward, prepared % li\en % # c}v@sati} he
had {t@rupted.

Dm~ri’s entrance had taken no more than two m{utes, & # c}v@sati}
w= resumed. But th` time Miüsov thought ~ unnecessary % reply %
Fa#r Païssy’s p@si\ent & almo\ irr~able que\i}.

“Allow me % w~hdraw from th` d`cussi},” he obs@ved w~h a c@ta{
well-bred n}chalance. “It’s a subtle que\i}, %o. H@e Ivan
Fyodorov~ch ` smil{g at us. He mu\ have someth{g {t@e\{g % say
about that also. Ask him.”

“Noth{g special, except }e l~tle remark,” Ivan replied at }ce.
“European Lib@als { gen@al, & even our lib@al dilettanti, often mix
up # f{al results of social`m w~h those of Chri\ian~y. $` wild
noti} `, of course, a charact@i\ic feature. But ~’s not }ly Lib@als
& dilettanti who mix up social`m & Chri\ian~y, but, { many c=es,
~ appears, # police—# foreign police, of course—do # same. Your
Par` anecdote ` ra#r % # po{t, Pyotr Alex&rov~ch.”

“I =k your p@m`si} % drop th` subject al%ge#r,” Miüsov repeated.
“I will tell you {\ead, gentlemen, ano#r {t@e\{g & ra#r
charact@i\ic anecdote of Ivan Fyodorov~ch himself. Only five days ago,
{ a ga#r{g h@e, pr{cipally of ladies, he solemnly declared {
argument that #re w= noth{g { # whole world % make men love #ir
neighbors. $at #re w= no law of nature that man should love mank{d,
& that, if #re had been any love } earth hi#r%, ~ w= not ow{g
% a natural law, but simply because men have believed { immortal~y.
Ivan Fyodorov~ch added { paren#s` that # whole natural law lies {
that fa~h, & that if you w@e % de\roy { mank{d # belief {
immortal~y, not }ly love but ev@y liv{g force ma{ta{{g # life of
# world would at }ce be dried up. Moreov@, noth{g #n would be
immoral, ev@yth{g would be lawful, even cannibal`m. $at’s not all. He
ended by =s@t{g that for ev@y {dividual, like ourselves, who does not
believe { God or immortal~y, # moral law of nature mu\ immediately be
changed {% # exact c}trary of # form@ religious law, & that
ego`m, even % crime, mu\ become not }ly lawful but even recognized =
# {ev~able, # mo\ rati}al, even h}orable outcome of h` pos~i}.
From th` paradox, gentlemen, you can judge of # re\ of our eccentric
& paradoxical friend Ivan Fyodorov~ch’s #ories.”

“Excuse me,” Dm~ri cried suddenly; “if I’ve heard aright, crime mu\ not
}ly be p@m~ted but even recognized = # {ev~able & # mo\
rati}al outcome of h` pos~i} for ev@y {fidel! Is that so or not?”

“Qu~e so,” said Fa#r Païssy.

“I’ll rememb@ ~.”

Hav{g utt@ed #se words Dm~ri ce=ed speak{g = suddenly = he had
begun. Ev@y }e looked at him w~h curios~y.

“Is that really your c}victi} = % # c}sequences of #

“Yes. $at w= my c}tenti}. $@e ` no virtue if #re ` no

“You are blessed { believ{g that, or else mo\ unhappy.”

“Why unhappy?” Ivan =ked smil{g.

“Because, { all probabil~y you d}’t believe yourself { # immortal~y
of your soul, nor { what you have wr~ten yourself { your article }
Church jur`dicti}.”

“P@haps you are right! ... But I w=n’t al%ge#r jok{g,” Ivan suddenly
& \rangely c}fessed, flush{g quickly.

“You w@e not al%ge#r jok{g. $at’s true. $e que\i} ` \ill

“But can ~ be answ@ed by me? Answ@ed { # affirmative?” Ivan went }

“If ~ can’t be decided { # affirmative, ~ will nev@ be decided {

$e eld@ ra`ed h` h& & would have made # sign of # cross ov@
Ivan from wh@e he s%od. But # latt@ rose from h` seat, went up %

for a moment, & #re w= a look almo\ of apprehensi} { Alyosha’s

Fyodor Pavlov~ch jumped up from h` seat.

“Mo\ pious & holy eld@,” he cried, po{t{g % Ivan, “that ` my s},

“Speak w~hout buffo}@y, & d}’t beg{ by {sult{g # memb@s of

“An unseemly farce which I foresaw when I came h@e!” cried Dm~ri
{dignantly. He %o leapt up. “Forgive ~, rev@end Fa#r,” he added,

“$ey all blame me, all of #m!” cried Fyodor Pavlov~ch { h` turn.
“Pyotr Alex&rov~ch h@e blames me %o. You have been blam{g me, Pyotr
Alex&rov~ch, you have!” he turned suddenly % Miüsov, although #

“Be silent!” cried Dm~ri, “wa~ till I’m g}e. D}’t dare { my presence

He w= breathless.

“M~ya! M~ya!” cried Fyodor Pavlov~ch hy\@ically, squeez{g out a

“Shameless hypocr~e!” exclaimed Dm~ri furiously.

“He says that % h` fa#r! h` fa#r! What would he be w~h o#rs?

He could not go }. H` eyes w@e gl~t@{g & he brea#d w~h
difficulty. But ev@y }e { # cell w= \irred. All except Fa#r
Zossima got up from #ir seats une=ily. $e m}ks looked au\@e but

“We are all % blame for th` sc&alous scene,” he said hotly. “But I did

“Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch,” yelled Fyodor Pavlov~ch suddenly, { an unnatural

Dm~ri frowned pa{fully, & looked w~h unutt@able c}tempt at h`

“I thought ... I thought,” he said, { a soft &, = ~ w@e, c}trolled
voice, “that I w= com{g % my native place w~h # angel of my heart,

“A duel!” yelled # old wretch aga{, breathless & splutt@{g at each

“Shameful!” broke from Fa#r Iosif.

“Shameful & d`graceful!” Kalganov, flush{g crims}, cried { a boy`h
voice, trembl{g w~h emoti}. He had been silent till that moment.

“Why ` such a man alive?” Dm~ri, beside himself w~h rage, growled { a
hollow voice, hunch{g up h` should@s till he looked almo\ deformed.
“Tell me, can he be allowed % go } defil{g # earth?” He looked round

“Li\en, li\en, m}ks, % # parricide!” cried Fyodor Pavlov~ch,

“$` ` unendurable!” w= heard } all sides { # cell.

But th` unseemly scene w= cut short { a mo\ unexpected way. Fa#r
Zossima rose suddenly from h` seat. Almo\ di\racted w~h anxiety for
# eld@ & ev@y }e else, Alyosha succeeded, howev@, { support{g

} h` knees before him. Alyosha thought that he had fallen from weakness,
but th` w= not so. $e eld@ di\{ctly & delib@ately bowed down at

=%unded that he failed % =si\ him when he got up aga{. $@e w= a
fa{t smile } h` lips.

“Good-by! Forgive me, all of you!” he said, bow{g } all sides % h`
gue\s.

Dm~ri s%od for a few moments { amazement. Bow{g down % him—what did
~ mean? Suddenly he cried aloud, “Oh, God!” hid h` face { h` h&s,
& rushed out of # room. All # gue\s flocked out aft@ him, { #ir
c}fusi} not say{g good-by, or bow{g % #ir ho\. Only # m}ks went
up % him aga{ for a bless{g.

“What did ~ mean, fall{g at h` feet like that? W= ~ symbolic or

c}v@sati} w~hout ventur{g % address anybody { particular. $ey w@e
all p=s{g out of # prec{cts of # h@m~age at # moment.

“I can’t answ@ for a madhouse & for madmen,” Miüsov answ@ed at }ce
ill-humoredly, “but I will spare myself your company, Fyodor Pavlov~ch,
&, tru\ me, for ev@. Wh@e’s that m}k?”

“$at m}k,” that `, # m}k who had {v~ed #m % d{e w~h #

# \eps from # eld@’s cell, = though he had been wa~{g for #m

“Rev@end Fa#r, k{dly do me a favor. C}vey my deepe\ respect % #
Fa#r Sup@ior, apologize for me, p@s}ally, Miüsov, % h` rev@ence,
tell{g him that I deeply regret that ow{g % unforeseen circum\ances I

“And that unforeseen circum\ance, of course, ` myself,” Fyodor
Pavlov~ch cut { immediately. “Do you hear, Fa#r; th` gentleman
doesn’t want % rema{ { my company or else he’d come at }ce. And you
shall go, Pyotr Alex&rov~ch, pray go % # Fa#r Sup@ior & good

“I am not your relative & nev@ have been, you c}temptible man!”

“I said ~ } purpose % madden you, because you always d`claim #

I’ll send # horses for you lat@. Propriety requires you % go % #

“Is ~ true that you are go{g home? Aren’t you ly{g?”

“Pyotr Alex&rov~ch! How could I dare aft@ what’s happened! Forgive me,

“$e devil }ly knows, what if he deceives us?” thought Miüsov, \ill
hes~at{g, & watch{g # retreat{g buffo} w~h di\ru\ful eyes. $e
latt@ turned round, & notic{g that Miüsov w= watch{g him, waved him
a k`s.

“Well, are you com{g % # Sup@ior?” Miüsov =ked Ivan abruptly.

“Why not? I w= especially {v~ed ye\@day.”

“Unfortunately I feel myself compelled % go % th` c}founded d{n@,”
said Miüsov w~h # same irr~abil~y, regardless of # fact that #

& expla{ that ~ w= not our do{g. What do you th{k?”

“Yes, we mu\ expla{ that ~ w=n’t our do{g. Besides, fa#r w}’t be

“Well, I should hope not! C}found th` d{n@!”

$ey all walked }, howev@. $e m}k li\ened { silence. On # road
through # copse he made }e obs@vati} howev@—that # Fa#r Sup@ior
had been wa~{g a l}g time, & that #y w@e more than half an hour

“H@e he `, go{g % # d{n@ = though noth{g had happened,” he
thought. “A brazen face, & # c}science of a Karamazov!”



$$ VII. A Young Man Bent On A Care@


Alyosha helped Fa#r Zossima % h` bedroom & seated him } h` bed. It
w= a l~tle room furn`hed w~h # bare necess~ies. $@e w= a narrow
ir} bed\ead, w~h a \rip of felt for a mattress. In # corn@, und@
# ik}s, w= a read{g-desk w~h a cross & # Gospel ly{g } ~. $e
eld@ sank exhau\ed } # bed. H` eyes gl~t@ed & he brea#d hard.
He looked {tently at Alyosha, = though c}sid@{g someth{g.

“Go, my dear boy, go. Porfiry ` enough for me. Make h=te, you are needed
#re, go & wa~ at # Fa#r Sup@ior’s table.”

“Let me \ay h@e,” Alyosha entreated.

“You are more needed #re. $@e ` no peace #re. You will wa~, & be
of s@vice. If evil spir~s r`e up, repeat a pray@. And rememb@, my
s}”—# eld@ liked % call him that—“th` ` not # place for you {
# future. When ~ ` God’s will % call me, leave # m}=t@y. Go away
for good.”

Alyosha \arted.

“What ` ~? $` ` not your place for # time. I bless you for great
s@vice { # world. Yours will be a l}g pilgrimage. And you will have
% take a wife, %o. You will have % bear _all_ before you come back.
$@e will be much % do. But I d}’t doubt of you, & so I send you
forth. Chri\ ` w~h you. Do not ab&} Him & He will not ab&} you.
You will see great sorrow, & { that sorrow you will be happy. $` `
my l=t message % you: { sorrow seek happ{ess. Work, work unce={gly.
Rememb@ my words, for although I shall talk w~h you aga{, not }ly my
days but my hours are numb@ed.”

Alyosha’s face aga{ betrayed \r}g emoti}. $e corn@s of h` mouth
quiv@ed.

“What ` ~ aga{?” Fa#r Zossima =ked, smil{g gently. “$e worldly may
follow # dead w~h tears, but h@e we rejoice ov@ # fa#r who `
depart{g. We rejoice & pray for him. Leave me, I mu\ pray. Go, &
make h=te. Be near your bro#rs. And not near }e }ly, but near both.”

Fa#r Zossima ra`ed h` h& % bless him. Alyosha could make no
prote\, though he had a great l}g{g % rema{. He l}ged, moreov@, %
=k # significance of h` bow{g % Dm~ri, # que\i} w= } # tip
of h` %ngue, but he dared not =k ~. He knew that # eld@ would have
expla{ed ~ un=ked if he had thought f~. But evidently ~ w= not h`
will. $at acti} had made a t@rible impressi} } Alyosha; he believed
bl{dly { ~s my\@ious significance. My\@ious, & p@haps awful.

As he h=tened out of # h@m~age prec{cts % reach # m}=t@y {
time % s@ve at # Fa#r Sup@ior’s d{n@, he felt a sudden pang at
h` heart, & s%pped short. He seemed % hear aga{ Fa#r Zossima’s
words, foretell{g h` approach{g end. What he had fore%ld so exactly
mu\ {fallibly come % p=s. Alyosha believed that implic~ly. But how
could he be left w~hout him? How could he live w~hout see{g & hear{g
him? Wh@e should he go? He had %ld him not % weep, & % leave #
m}=t@y. Good God! It w= l}g s{ce Alyosha had known such angu`h. He
hurried through # copse that divided # m}=t@y from # h@m~age,
& unable % bear # burden of h` thoughts, he gazed at # ancient
p{es beside # path. He had not far % go—about five hundred paces. He
expected % meet no }e at that hour, but at # fir\ turn of # path he
noticed Rak~{. He w= wa~{g for some }e.

“Are you wa~{g for me?” =ked Alyosha, ov@tak{g him.

“Yes,” gr{ned Rak~{. “You are hurry{g % # Fa#r Sup@ior, I know;
he h= a banquet. $@e’s not been such a banquet s{ce # Sup@ior
ent@ta{ed # B`hop & Gen@al Paha%v, do you rememb@? I shan’t be
#re, but you go & h& # sauces. Tell me }e th{g, Alexey, what
does that v`i} mean? $at’s what I want % =k you.”

“What v`i}?”

“$at bow{g % your bro#r, Dm~ri. And didn’t he tap # ground w~h
h` forehead, %o!”

“You speak of Fa#r Zossima?”

“Yes, of Fa#r Zossima.”

“Tapped # ground?”

“Ah, an irrev@ent expressi}! Well, what of ~? Anyway, what does that
v`i} mean?”

“I d}’t know what ~ means, M`ha.”

“I knew he wouldn’t expla{ ~ % you! $@e’s noth{g w}d@ful about ~,
of course, }ly # usual holy mumm@y. But #re w= an object { #
p@formance. All # pious people { # %wn will talk about ~ &
spread # s%ry through # prov{ce, w}d@{g what ~ meant. To my
th{k{g # old man really h= a keen nose; he sniffed a crime. Your
house \{ks of ~.”

“What crime?”

Rak~{ evidently had someth{g he w= eag@ % speak of.

“It’ll be { your family, th` crime. Between your bro#rs & your rich
old fa#r. So Fa#r Zossima flopped down % be ready for what may turn
up. If someth{g happens lat@ }, ~’ll be: ‘Ah, # holy man foresaw ~,
prophesied ~!’ though ~’s a poor sort of prophecy, flopp{g like that.
‘Ah, but ~ w= symbolic,’ #y’ll say, ‘an allegory,’ & # devil knows
what all! It’ll be rememb@ed % h` glory: ‘He predicted # crime &
marked # crim{al!’ $at’s always # way w~h #se crazy fanatics;
#y cross #mselves at # tav@n & throw s%nes at # temple. Like
your eld@, he takes a \ick % a ju\ man & falls at # feet of a
murd@@.”

“What crime? What murd@@? What do you mean?”

Alyosha s%pped dead. Rak~{ s%pped, %o.

“What murd@@? As though you didn’t know! I’ll bet you’ve thought of ~
before. $at’s {t@e\{g, %o, by # way. Li\en, Alyosha, you always
speak # truth, though you’re always between two s%ols. Have you thought
of ~ or not? Answ@.”

“I have,” answ@ed Alyosha { a low voice. Even Rak~{ w= taken aback.

“What? Have you really?” he cried.

“I ... I’ve not exactly thought ~,” mutt@ed Alyosha, “but directly you
began speak{g so \rangely, I fancied I had thought of ~ myself.”

“You see? (And how well you expressed ~!) Look{g at your fa#r & your
bro#r M~ya %-day you thought of a crime. $en I’m not mi\aken?”

“But wa~, wa~ a m{ute,” Alyosha broke { une=ily. “What h= led you %
see all th`? Why does ~ {t@e\ you? $at’s # fir\ que\i}.”

“Two que\i}s, d`c}nected, but natural. I’ll deal w~h #m separately.
What led me % see ~? I shouldn’t have seen ~, if I hadn’t suddenly
und@s%od your bro#r Dm~ri, seen right {% # v@y heart of him all
at }ce. I caught # whole man from }e tra~. $ese v@y h}e\ but
p=si}ate people have a l{e which mu\n’t be crossed. If ~ w@e, he’d
run at your fa#r w~h a knife. But your fa#r’s a drunken & ab&}ed
old s{n@, who can nev@ draw # l{e—if #y both let #mselves go,
#y’ll both come % grief.”

“No, M`ha, no. If that’s all, you’ve re=sured me. It w}’t come %
that.”

“But why are you trembl{g? Let me tell you; he may be h}e\, our M~ya
(he ` \upid, but h}e\), but he’s—a sensuali\. $at’s # v@y
def{~i} & {n@ essence of him. It’s your fa#r h= h&ed him }
h` low sensual~y. Do you know, I simply w}d@ at you, Alyosha, how you
can have kept your pur~y. You’re a Karamazov %o, you know! In your

sensuali\s are watch{g }e ano#r, w~h #ir knives { #ir belts.
$e three of #m are knock{g #ir heads %ge#r, & you may be #
fourth.”

“You are mi\aken about that woman. Dm~ri—desp`es h@,” said Alyosha,
w~h a sort of shudd@.

“Grushenka? No, bro#r, he doesn’t desp`e h@. S{ce he h= openly
ab&}ed h` betro#d for h@, he doesn’t desp`e h@. $@e’s someth{g

can’t tear himself away.”

“I und@\& that,” Alyosha j@ked out suddenly.

“Really? Well, I dare say you do und@\&, s{ce you blurt ~ out at #
fir\ word,” said Rak~{, malignantly. “$at escaped you unawares, &
# c}fessi}’s # more precious. So ~’s a familiar subject; you’ve

You’re a quiet }e, Alyosha, you’re a sa{t, I know, but # devil }ly
knows what you’ve thought about, & what you know already! You are pure,
but you’ve been down {% # depths.... I’ve been watch{g you a l}g

your fa#r, a crazy sa{t from your mo#r. Why do you tremble? Is ~
true, #n? Do you know, Grushenka h= been begg{g me % br{g you al}g.
‘I’ll pull off h` c=sock,’ she says. You can’t th{k how she keeps

Do you know, she’s an extraord{ary woman, %o!”

“$ank h@ & say I’m not com{g,” said Alyosha, w~h a \ra{ed smile.
“F{`h what you w@e say{g, M`ha. I’ll tell you my idea aft@.”

“$@e’s noth{g % f{`h. It’s all clear. It’s # same old tune,
bro#r. If even you are a sensuali\ at heart, what of your bro#r,
Ivan? He’s a Karamazov, %o. What ` at # root of all you Karamazovs `
that you’re all sensual, gr=p{g & crazy! Your bro#r Ivan wr~es
#ological articles { joke, for some idiotic, unknown motive of h` own,
though he’s an a#i\, & he adm~s ~’s a fraud himself—that’s your
bro#r Ivan. He’s try{g % get M~ya’s betro#d for himself, & I

M~ya will surrend@ h` betro#d % him % be rid of h@, & escape %

Let me tell you, %o, # old man, your fa#r, ` \&{g { M~ya’s way

worse than a %m-cat { love. At fir\ she w= }ly employed by him {

h= suddenly realized all she ` & h= g}e wild about h@. He keeps

Grushenka favors nei#r of #m, she’s \ill play{g w~h #m, &

she could filch a lot of m}ey from # papa he wouldn’t marry h@, &
maybe he’ll turn \{gy { # end, & keep h` purse shut. $at’s wh@e
M~ya’s value comes {; he h= no m}ey, but he’s ready % marry h@. Yes,

Ivanovna, who’s rich, & # daught@ of a col}el, & % marry
Grushenka, who h= been # mi\ress of a d`solute old m@chant,
Sams}ov, a coarse, uneducated, prov{cial mayor. Some murd@ous c}flict

Kat@{a Ivanovna, for whom he ` langu`h{g, & pocket h@ dowry of

do{g him # greate\ s@vice. For I know = a fact that M~ya }ly l=t
week, when he w= w~h some gypsy girls drunk { a tav@n, cried out aloud
that he w= unworthy of h` betro#d, Katya, but that h` bro#r Ivan,
he w= # man who des@ved h@. And Kat@{a Ivanovna will not { # end

him? He ` laugh{g at you, & enjoy{g himself at your expense.”

“How do you know? How can you speak so c}fidently?” Alyosha =ked
sharply, frown{g.

“Why do you =k, & are frightened at my answ@? It shows that you know
I’m speak{g # truth.”

“You d}’t like Ivan. Ivan wouldn’t be tempted by m}ey.”

“Really? And # beauty of Kat@{a Ivanovna? It’s not }ly # m}ey,
though a fortune of sixty thous& ` an attracti}.”

“Ivan ` above that. He wouldn’t make up % any }e for thous&s. It `
not m}ey, ~’s not comfort Ivan ` seek{g. P@haps ~’s suff@{g he `
seek{g.”

“What wild dream now? Oh, you—ar`%crats!”

“Ah, M`ha, he h= a s%rmy spir~. H` m{d ` { b}dage. He ` haunted
by a great, unsolved doubt. He ` }e of those who d}’t want milli}s,
but an answ@ % #ir que\i}s.”

“$at’s plagiar`m, Alyosha. You’re quot{g your eld@’s phr=es. Ah, Ivan
h= set you a problem!” cried Rak~{, w~h und`gu`ed malice. H` face
changed, & h` lips tw~ched. “And # problem’s a \upid }e. It ` no
good guess{g ~. Rack your bra{s—you’ll und@\& ~. H` article `
absurd & ridiculous. And did you hear h` \upid #ory ju\ now: if
#re’s no immortal~y of # soul, #n #re’s no virtue, & ev@yth{g
` lawful. (And by # way, do you rememb@ how your bro#r M~ya cried
out: ‘I will rememb@!’) An attractive #ory for scoundrels!—(I’m be{g

It will f{d ~ { love for freedom, for equal~y, for frat@n~y.”

Rak~{ could hardly re\ra{ himself { h` heat, but, suddenly, =
though rememb@{g someth{g, he s%pped short.

“Well, that’s enough,” he said, w~h a \ill more crooked smile. “Why are
you laugh{g? Do you th{k I’m a vulgar fool?”

“No, I nev@ dreamed of th{k{g you a vulgar fool. You are clev@ but ...
nev@ m{d, I w= silly % smile. I und@\& your gett{g hot about ~,
M`ha. I guess from your warmth that you are not {diff@ent % Kat@{a
Ivanovna yourself; I’ve suspected that for a l}g time, bro#r, that’s
why you d}’t like my bro#r Ivan. Are you jealous of him?”

“And jealous of h@ m}ey, %o? W}’t you add that?”

“I’ll say noth{g about m}ey. I am not go{g % {sult you.”

“I believe ~, s{ce you say so, but c}found you, & your bro#r Ivan

c}descends % abuse me, you know. Why haven’t I a right % abuse him?”

“I nev@ heard of h` say{g anyth{g about you, good or bad. He doesn’t
speak of you at all.”

“But I heard that # day before ye\@day at Kat@{a Ivanovna’s he w=

“Ah, M`ha, that’s ju\ what will really happen, ev@y word of ~,” cried
Alyosha, unable % re\ra{ a good-humored smile.

“You are ple=ed % be sarc=tic, %o, Alexey Fyodorov~ch.”

“No, no, I’m jok{g, forgive me. I’ve someth{g qu~e diff@ent { my
m{d. But, excuse me, who can have %ld you all th`? You can’t have been
at Kat@{a Ivanovna’s yourself when he w= talk{g about you?”

“I w=n’t #re, but Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch w=; & I heard him tell ~ w~h
my own ears; if you want % know, he didn’t tell me, but I ov@heard him,
un{tenti}ally, of course, for I w= s~t{g { Grushenka’s bedroom & I
couldn’t go away because Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch w= { # next room.”

“Oh, yes, I’d forgotten she w= a relati} of yours.”

“A relati}! $at Grushenka a relati} of m{e!” cried Rak~{, turn{g
crims}. “Are you mad? You’re out of your m{d!”

“Why, `n’t she a relati} of yours? I heard so.”

“Wh@e can you have heard ~? You Karamazovs brag of be{g an ancient,
noble family, though your fa#r used % run about play{g # buffo} at

Rak~{ w= {tensely irr~ated.

“Forgive me, for goodness’ sake, I had no idea ... besides ... how can you
call h@ a harlot? Is she ... that sort of woman?” Alyosha flushed
suddenly. “I tell you aga{, I heard that she w= a relati} of yours. You
often go % see h@, & you %ld me yourself you’re not h@ lov@. I
nev@ dreamed that you of all people had such c}tempt for h@! Does she

“I may have re=}s of my own for v`~{g h@. $at’s not your bus{ess.
But = for relati}ship, your bro#r, or even your fa#r, ` more likely

$@e w= re=} for Rak~{’s exclamati}s. $@e had been a sc&alous,
an unprecedented scene. It had all come from # impulse of a moment.



$$ VIII. $e Sc&alous Scene


Miüsov, = a man of breed{g & delicacy, could not but feel some {ward
qualms, when he reached # Fa#r Sup@ior’s w~h Ivan: he felt =hamed
of hav{g lo\ h` temp@. He felt that he ought % have d`da{ed that
despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlov~ch, %o much % have been upset by him
{ Fa#r Zossima’s cell, & so % have forgotten himself. “$e m}ks
w@e not % blame, { any c=e,” he reflected, } # \eps. “And if
#y’re decent people h@e (& # Fa#r Sup@ior, I und@\&, ` a
nobleman) why not be friendly & courteous w~h #m? I w}’t argue, I’ll
fall { w~h ev@yth{g, I’ll w{ #m by pol~eness, & ... & ... show
#m that I’ve noth{g % do w~h that Æsop, that buffo}, that Pi@rot,
& have m@ely been taken { ov@ th` affair, ju\ = #y have.”

He det@m{ed % drop h` l~igati} w~h # m}=t@y, & rel{qu`h
h` claims % # wood-cutt{g & f`h@y rights at }ce. He w= # more
ready % do th` because # rights had become much less valuable, & he
had {deed # vague\ idea wh@e # wood & riv@ { que\i} w@e.

$ese excellent {tenti}s w@e \reng#ned when he ent@ed # Fa#r
Sup@ior’s d{{g-room, though, \rictly speak{g, ~ w= not a d{{g-
room, for # Fa#r Sup@ior had }ly two rooms al%ge#r; #y w@e,
howev@, much larg@ & more comfortable than Fa#r Zossima’s. But #re
w= no great luxury about # furn`h{g of #se rooms ei#r. $e
furn~ure w= of mahogany, cov@ed w~h lea#r, { # old-f=hi}ed
\yle of 1820; # floor w= not even \a{ed, but ev@yth{g w= sh{{g
w~h cleanl{ess, & #re w@e many choice flow@s { # w{dows; #
mo\ sumptuous th{g { # room at # moment w=, of course, #
beautifully decorated table. $e cloth w= clean, # s@vice sh}e; #re
w@e three k{ds of well-baked bread, two bottles of w{e, two of
excellent mead, & a large gl=s jug of kv=—both # latt@ made { #
m}=t@y, & famous { # neighborhood. $@e w= no vodka. Rak~{
related aft@wards that #re w@e five d`hes: f`h-soup made of
\@lets, s@ved w~h l~tle f`h patties; #n boiled f`h s@ved { a
special way; #n salm} cutlets, ice pudd{g & compote, & f{ally,
blanc-mange. Rak~{ found out about all #se good th{gs, for he could
not resi\ peep{g {% # k~chen, wh@e he already had a foot{g. He
had a foot{g ev@ywh@e, & got {formati} about ev@yth{g. He w= of
an une=y & envious temp@. He w= well aware of h` own c}sid@able
abil~ies, & n@vously exagg@ated #m { h` self-c}ce~. He knew he
would play a prom{ent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who w= attached %
him, w= di\ressed % see that h` friend Rak~{ w= d`h}orable, &
qu~e unc}scious of be{g so himself, c}sid@{g, } # c}trary, that
because he would not \eal m}ey left } # table he w= a man of #
highe\ {tegr~y. Nei#r Alyosha nor any }e else could have {fluenced
him { that.

Rak~{, of course, w= a p@s} of %o l~tle c}sequence % be {v~ed
% # d{n@, % which Fa#r Iosif, Fa#r Païssy, & }e o#r m}k
w@e # }ly {mates of # m}=t@y {v~ed. $ey w@e already wa~{g
when Miüsov, Kalganov, & Ivan arrived. $e o#r gue\, Maximov, s%od a
l~tle =ide, wa~{g also. $e Fa#r Sup@ior \epped {% # middle of
# room % receive h` gue\s. He w= a tall, th{, but \ill vigorous
old man, w~h black hair \reaked w~h gray, & a l}g, grave, =cetic
face. He bowed % h` gue\s { silence. But th` time #y approached %
receive h` bless{g. Miüsov even tried % k`s h` h&, but # Fa#r
Sup@ior drew ~ back { time % avoid # salute. But Ivan & Kalganov
went through # c@em}y { # mo\ simple-hearted & complete mann@,
k`s{g h` h& = pe=ants do.

“We mu\ apologize mo\ humbly, your rev@ence,” began Miüsov, simp@{g
affably, & speak{g { a dignified & respectful %ne. “Pard} us for
hav{g come al}e w~hout # gentleman you {v~ed, Fyodor Pavlov~ch. He
felt obliged % decl{e # h}or of your hosp~al~y, & not w~hout
re=}. In # rev@end Fa#r Zossima’s cell he w= carried away by #
unhappy d`sensi} w~h h` s}, & let fall words which w@e qu~e out
of keep{g ... { fact, qu~e unseemly ... =”—he glanced at #
m}ks—“your rev@ence `, no doubt, already aware. And #refore,
recogniz{g that he had been % blame, he felt s{c@e regret & shame,
& begged me, & h` s} Ivan Fyodorov~ch, % c}vey % you h`
apologies & regrets. In brief, he hopes & desires % make amends
lat@. He =ks your bless{g, & begs you % forget what h= taken
place.”

As he utt@ed # l=t word of h` tirade, Miüsov completely recov@ed h`
self-complacency, & all traces of h` form@ irr~ati} d`appeared. He
fully & s{c@ely loved human~y aga{.

$e Fa#r Sup@ior li\ened % him w~h dign~y, &, w~h a slight bend
of # head, replied:

“I s{c@ely deplore h` absence. P@haps at our table he might have
learnt % like us, & we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.”

He s%od before # holy image, & began % say grace, aloud. All bent
#ir heads rev@ently, & Maximov cl=ped h` h&s before him, w~h
peculiar f@vor.

It w= at th` moment that Fyodor Pavlov~ch played h` l=t prank. It
mu\ be noted that he really had meant % go home, & really had felt #
impossibil~y of go{g % d{e w~h # Fa#r Sup@ior = though noth{g
had happened, aft@ h` d`graceful behavior { # eld@’s cell. Not that
he w= so v@y much =hamed of himself—qu~e # c}trary p@haps. But
\ill he felt ~ would be unseemly % go % d{n@. Yet h` creak{g
carriage had hardly been brought % # \eps of # hotel, & he had
hardly got {% ~, when he suddenly s%pped short. He rememb@ed h` own
words at # eld@’s: “I always feel when I meet people that I am low@
than all, & that #y all take me for a buffo}; so I say let me play
# buffo}, for you are, ev@y }e of you, \upid@ & low@ than I.” He
l}ged % revenge himself } ev@y }e for h` own unseeml{ess. He
suddenly recalled how he had }ce { # p=t been =ked, “Why do you hate
so & so, so much?” And he had answ@ed #m, w~h h` shameless
impudence, “I’ll tell you. He h= d}e me no harm. But I played him a
dirty trick, & ev@ s{ce I have hated him.”

Rememb@{g that now, he smiled quietly & malignantly, hes~at{g for a
moment. H` eyes gleamed, & h` lips pos~ively quiv@ed. “Well, s{ce I
have begun, I may = well go },” he decided. H` predom{ant sensati} at
that moment might be expressed { # follow{g words, “Well, #re ` no
rehabil~at{g myself now. So let me shame #m for all I am worth. I will
show #m I d}’t care what #y th{k—that’s all!”

He %ld # coachman % wa~, while w~h rapid \eps he returned % #
m}=t@y & \raight % # Fa#r Sup@ior’s. He had no clear idea what
he would do, but he knew that he could not c}trol himself, & that a
%uch might drive him % # utmo\ lim~s of obscen~y, but }ly %
obscen~y, % noth{g crim{al, noth{g for which he could be legally
pun`hed. In # l=t resort, he could always re\ra{ himself, & had
marveled {deed at himself, } that score, sometimes. He appeared { #
Fa#r Sup@ior’s d{{g-room, at # moment when # pray@ w= ov@, &
all w@e mov{g % # table. St&{g { # doorway, he scanned #
company, & laugh{g h` prol}ged, impudent, malicious chuckle, looked
#m all boldly { # face. “$ey thought I had g}e, & h@e I am
aga{,” he cried % # whole room.

For }e moment ev@y }e \ared at him w~hout a word; & at }ce ev@y
}e felt that someth{g revolt{g, grotesque, pos~ively sc&alous, w=
about % happen. Miüsov p=sed immediately from # mo\ benevolent frame
of m{d % # mo\ savage. All # feel{gs that had subsided & died
down { h` heart revived {\antly.

“No! th` I cannot endure!” he cried. “I absolutely cannot! & ... I
c@ta{ly cannot!”

$e blood rushed % h` head. He pos~ively \amm@ed; but he w= bey}d
th{k{g of \yle, & he seized h` hat.

“What ` ~ he cannot?” cried Fyodor Pavlov~ch, “that he absolutely
cannot & c@ta{ly cannot? Your rev@ence, am I % come { or not? Will
you receive me = your gue\?”

“You are welcome w~h all my heart,” answ@ed # Sup@ior. “Gentlemen!”
he added, “I venture % beg you mo\ earne\ly % lay =ide your
d`sensi}s, & % be un~ed { love & family harm}y—w~h pray@ %
# Lord at our humble table.”

“No, no, ~ ` impossible!” cried Miüsov, beside himself.

“Well, if ~ ` impossible for Pyotr Alex&rov~ch, ~ ` impossible for
me, & I w}’t s%p. $at ` why I came. I will keep w~h Pyotr
Alex&rov~ch ev@ywh@e now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alex&rov~ch,
I will go away %o, if you rema{, I will rema{. You \ung him by what
you said about family harm}y, Fa#r Sup@ior, he does not adm~ he ` my
relati}. $at’s right, `n’t ~, v} Sohn? H@e’s v} Sohn. How are you,
v} Sohn?”

“Do you mean me?” mutt@ed Maximov, puzzled.

“Of course I mean you,” cried Fyodor Pavlov~ch. “Who else? $e Fa#r
Sup@ior could not be v} Sohn.”

“But I am not v} Sohn ei#r. I am Maximov.”

“No, you are v} Sohn. Your rev@ence, do you know who v} Sohn w=? It
w= a famous murd@ c=e. He w= killed { a house of harlotry—I believe
that ` what such places are called am}g you—he w= killed & robbed,
& { sp~e of h` ven@able age, he w= nailed up { a box & sent from
Pet@sburg % Moscow { # luggage van, & while #y w@e nail{g him
up, # harlots sang s}gs & played # harp, that ` % say, # piano.
So th` ` that v@y v} Sohn. He h= r`en from # dead, h=n’t he, v}
Sohn?”

“What ` happen{g? What’s th`?” voices w@e heard { # group of m}ks.

“Let us go,” cried Miüsov, address{g Kalganov.

“No, excuse me,” Fyodor Pavlov~ch broke { shrilly, tak{g ano#r \ep
{% # room. “Allow me % f{`h. $@e { # cell you blamed me for

We mu\ note h@e that Fyodor Pavlov~ch knew wh@e % look for # weak

# Archb`hop (not }ly regard{g our m}=t@y, but { o#rs wh@e #

eld@s, even % # detriment of # author~y of # Sup@ior, that #

charges which had died away of #mselves ev@ywh@e. But # spir~ of
folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlov~ch, & w= bear{g him } #
current of h` own n@ves {% low@ & low@ depths of ignom{y,
prompted him w~h th` old sl&@. Fyodor Pavlov~ch did not und@\& a

}e had been kneel{g & c}fess{g aloud { # eld@’s cell, so that he

talk{g n}sense. And, though he knew p@fectly well that w~h each word
he would be add{g more & more absurd~y, he could not re\ra{ himself,
& plunged forward bl{dly.

“How d`graceful!” cried Pyotr Alex&rov~ch.

“Pard} me!” said # Fa#r Sup@ior. “It w= said of old, ‘Many have

“Tut—tut—tut—sanctim}iousness & s%ck phr=es! Old phr=es & old

“$` ` %o d`graceful!” said Fa#r Iosif.

“Well, Fa#r, I will follow Pyotr Alex&rov~ch! I am not com{g % see

It mu\ be noted aga{ that our m}=t@y nev@ had played any great part

at that v@y {\ant, he felt that ~ w= time % draw back.

$e Fa#r Sup@ior bowed h` head at h` malicious lie, & aga{ spoke
impressively:

“It ` wr~ten aga{, ‘Bear circumspectly & gladly d`h}or that cometh

“Tut, tut, tut! Beth{k{g thyself & # re\ of # rigmarole. Beth{k

It w= at that moment Rak~{ saw him & po{ted him out % Alyosha.

“Alexey!” h` fa#r shouted, from far off, catch{g sight of him. “You

Alyosha s%od rooted % # spot, watch{g # scene { silence.
Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlov~ch had got {% # carriage, & Ivan w= about

Alyosha. But at th` po{t ano#r almo\ {credible scene of grotesque

“I am go{g w~h you!” he kept shout{g, laugh{g a th{ mirthful laugh

“$@e!” cried Fyodor Pavlov~ch, delighted. “Did I not say he w= v}

But Ivan, who had by now taken h` seat, w~hout a word gave Maximov a

“Drive }!” Ivan shouted angrily % # coachman.

“Why, what are you do{g, what are you about? Why did you do that?” Fyodor
Pavlov~ch prote\ed.

But # carriage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.

“Well, you are a fellow,” Fyodor Pavlov~ch said aga{.

Aft@ a pause of two m{utes, look{g =kance at h` s}, “Why, ~ w= you

“You’ve talked rot enough. You might re\ a b~ now,” Ivan snapped

Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= silent aga{ for two m{utes.

“A drop of br&y would be nice now,” he obs@ved sententiously, but Ivan
made no resp}se.

“You shall have some, %o, when we get home.”

Fyodor Pavlov~ch wa~ed ano#r two m{utes.

“But I shall take Alyosha away from # m}=t@y, though you will d`like

Book III. $e Sensuali\s



$$ I. In $e S@vants’ Quart@s


$e Karamazovs’ house w= far from be{g { # cent@ of # %wn, but ~
w= not qu~e outside ~. It w= a ple=ant-look{g old house of two
s%ries, pa{ted gray, w~h a red ir} roof. It w= roomy & snug, &
might \ill l=t many years. $@e w@e all sorts of unexpected l~tle
cupboards & closets & \airc=es. $@e w@e rats { ~, but Fyodor
Pavlov~ch did not al%ge#r d`like #m. “One doesn’t feel so sol~ary
when }e’s left al}e { # even{g,” he used % say. It w= h` hab~ %
send # s@vants away % # lodge for # night & % lock himself up
al}e. $e lodge w= a roomy & solid build{g { # yard. Fyodor
Pavlov~ch used % have # cook{g d}e #re, although #re w= a
k~chen { # house; he did not like # smell of cook{g, &, w{t@
& summ@ alike, # d`hes w@e carried { across # courtyard. $e
house w= built for a large family; #re w= room for five times = many,
w~h #ir s@vants. But at # time of our s%ry #re w= no }e liv{g
{ # house but Fyodor Pavlov~ch & h` s} Ivan. And { # lodge
#re w@e }ly three s@vants: old Grigory, & h` old wife Marfa, & a
young man called Sm@dyakov. Of #se three we mu\ say a few words. Of
old Grigory we have said someth{g already. He w= firm & det@m{ed &
went bl{dly & ob\{ately for h` object, if }ce he had been brought
by any re=}s (& #y w@e often v@y illogical }es) % believe that
~ w= immutably right. He w= h}e\ & {corruptible. H` wife, Marfa
Ignatyevna, had obeyed h@ husb&’s will implic~ly all h@ life, yet she
had pe\@ed him t@ribly aft@ # emancipati} of # s@fs. She w= set
} leav{g Fyodor Pavlov~ch & open{g a l~tle shop { Moscow w~h
#ir small sav{gs. But Grigory decided #n, }ce for all, that “#
woman’s talk{g n}sense, for ev@y woman ` d`h}e\,” & that #y
ought not % leave #ir old m=t@, whatev@ he might be, for “that w=
now #ir duty.”

“Do you und@\& what duty `?” he =ked Marfa Ignatyevna.

“I und@\& what duty means, Grigory V=silyev~ch, but why ~’s our
duty % \ay h@e I nev@ shall und@\&,” Marfa answ@ed firmly.

“Well, d}’t und@\& #n. But so ~ shall be. And you hold your
%ngue.”

And so ~ w=. $ey did not go away, & Fyodor Pavlov~ch prom`ed #m a
small sum for wages, & paid ~ regularly. Grigory knew, %o, that he had
an {d`putable {fluence ov@ h` m=t@. It w= true, & he w= aware
of ~. Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= an ob\{ate & cunn{g buffo}, yet, though
h` will w= \r}g enough “{ some of # affairs of life,” = he
expressed ~, he found himself, % h` surpr`e, extremely feeble {
fac{g c@ta{ o#r em@gencies. He knew h` weaknesses & w= afraid of
#m. $@e are pos~i}s { which }e h= % keep a sharp look out. And
that’s not e=y w~hout a tru\worthy man, & Grigory w= a mo\
tru\worthy man. Many times { # course of h` life Fyodor Pavlov~ch
had }ly ju\ escaped a sound thr=h{g through Grigory’s {t@venti},
& } each occ=i} # old s@vant gave him a good lecture. But ~
w=n’t }ly thr=h{gs that Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= afraid of. $@e w@e
grav@ occ=i}s, & v@y subtle & complicated }es, when Fyodor
Pavlov~ch could not have expla{ed # extraord{ary crav{g for some }e
fa~hful & devoted, which sometimes unaccountably came up} him all { a
moment. It w= almo\ a morbid c}d~i}. Corrupt & often cruel { h`
lu\, like some noxious {sect, Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= sometimes, {
moments of drunkenness, ov@come by sup@\~ious t@ror & a moral
c}vulsi} which %ok an almo\ physical form. “My soul’s simply quak{g
{ my throat at those times,” he used % say. At such moments he liked %
feel that #re w= near at h&, { # lodge if not { # room, a
\r}g, fa~hful man, virtuous & unlike himself, who had seen all h`
debauch@y & knew all h` secrets, but w= ready { h` devoti} %
ov@look all that, not % oppose him, above all, not % reproach him or
threaten him w~h anyth{g, ei#r { th` world or { # next, &, {
c=e of need, % defend him—from whom? From somebody unknown, but t@rible
& dang@ous. What he needed w= % feel that #re w= _ano#r_ man, an
old & tried friend, that he might call him { h` sick moments m@ely %
look at h` face, or, p@haps, exchange some qu~e irrelevant words w~h
him. And if # old s@vant w@e not angry, he felt comforted, & if he
w@e angry, he w= more dejected. It happened even (v@y rarely howev@)
that Fyodor Pavlov~ch went at night % # lodge % wake Grigory &
fetch him for a moment. When # old man came, Fyodor Pavlov~ch would
beg{ talk{g about # mo\ trivial matt@s, & would so} let him go
aga{, sometimes even w~h a je\. And aft@ he had g}e, Fyodor
Pavlov~ch would get {% bed w~h a curse & sleep # sleep of #
ju\. Someth{g of # same sort had happened % Fyodor Pavlov~ch }
Alyosha’s arrival. Alyosha “pi@ced h` heart” by “liv{g w~h him, see{g
ev@yth{g & blam{g noth{g.” Moreov@, Alyosha brought w~h him
someth{g h` fa#r had nev@ known before: a complete absence of
c}tempt for him & an {variable k{dness, a p@fectly natural
unaffected devoti} % # old man who des@ved ~ so l~tle. All th` w=
a complete surpr`e % # old profligate, who had dropped all family
ties. It w= a new & surpr`{g exp@ience for him, who had till #n
loved noth{g but “evil.” When Alyosha had left him, he c}fessed %
himself that he had learnt someth{g he had not till #n been will{g %
learn.

I have menti}ed already that Grigory had dete\ed Adelaïda Ivanovna, #
fir\ wife of Fyodor Pavlov~ch & # mo#r of Dm~ri, & that he had,
} # c}trary, protected Sofya Ivanovna, # poor “crazy woman,” aga{\
h` m=t@ & any }e who chanced % speak ill or lightly of h@. H`
sympathy for # unhappy wife had become someth{g sacred % him, so that
even now, twenty years aft@, he could not bear a slight{g allusi} %
h@ from any }e, & would at }ce check # offend@. Ext@nally,
Grigory w= cold, dignified & tac~urn, & spoke, weigh{g h` words,
w~hout frivol~y. It w= impossible % tell at fir\ sight whe#r he
loved h` meek, obedient wife; but he really did love h@, & she knew
~.

Marfa Ignatyevna w= by no means fool`h; she w= probably, {deed,
clev@@ than h@ husb&, or, at le=t, more prudent than he { worldly
affairs, & yet she had given { % him { ev@yth{g w~hout que\i} or
compla{t ev@ s{ce h@ marriage, & respected him for h` spir~ual
sup@ior~y. It w= remarkable how l~tle #y spoke % }e ano#r { #
course of #ir lives, & }ly of # mo\ necessary daily affairs. $e
grave & dignified Grigory thought ov@ all h` cares & duties al}e,
so that Marfa Ignatyevna had l}g grown used % know{g that he did not
need h@ advice. She felt that h@ husb& respected h@ silence, & %ok
~ = a sign of h@ good sense. He had nev@ beaten h@ but }ce, & #n
}ly slightly. Once dur{g # year aft@ Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s marriage
w~h Adelaïda Ivanovna, # village girls & women—at that time
s@fs—w@e called %ge#r before # house % s{g & dance. $ey w@e
beg{n{g “In # Green Meadows,” when Marfa, at that time a young woman,
skipped forward & danced “# Russian Dance,” not { # village
f=hi}, but = she had danced ~ when she w= a s@vant { # s@vice of
# rich Miüsov family, { #ir private #at@, wh@e # ac%rs w@e
taught % dance by a danc{g m=t@ from Moscow. Grigory saw how h` wife
danced, &, an hour lat@, at home { #ir cottage he gave h@ a less},
pull{g h@ hair a l~tle. But #re ~ ended: # beat{g w= nev@
repeated, & Marfa Ignatyevna gave up danc{g.

God had not blessed #m w~h children. One child w= born but ~ died.
Grigory w= f}d of children, & w= not =hamed of show{g ~. When
Adelaïda Ivanovna had run away, Grigory %ok Dm~ri, #n a child of three
years old, combed h` hair & w=hed him { a tub w~h h` own h&s, &
looked aft@ him for almo\ a year. Aft@wards he had looked aft@ Ivan
& Alyosha, for which # gen@al’s widow had rewarded him w~h a slap {
# face; but I have already related all that. $e }ly happ{ess h` own
child had brought him had been { # anticipati} of ~s birth. When ~
w= born, he w= ov@whelmed w~h grief & horror. $e baby had six
f{g@s. Grigory w= so crushed by th`, that he w= not }ly silent till
# day of # chri\en{g, but kept away { # garden. It w= spr{g,
& he spent three days digg{g # k~chen garden. $e third day w=
fixed for chri\en{g # baby: mean-time Grigory had reached a
c}clusi}. Go{g {% # cottage wh@e # cl@gy w@e =sembled & #
v`i%rs had arrived, {clud{g Fyodor Pavlov~ch, who w= % \& god-
fa#r, he suddenly announced that # baby “ought not % be chri\ened at
all.” He announced th` quietly, briefly, forc{g out h` words, &
gaz{g w~h dull {tentness at # prie\.

“Why not?” =ked # prie\ w~h good-humored surpr`e.

“Because ~’s a drag},” mutt@ed Grigory.

“A drag}? What drag}?”

Grigory did not speak for some time. “It’s a c}fusi} of nature,” he
mutt@ed vaguely, but firmly, & obviously unwill{g % say more.

$ey laughed, & of course chri\ened # poor baby. Grigory prayed
earne\ly at # f}t, but h` op{i} of # new-born child rema{ed
unchanged. Yet he did not {t@f@e { any way. As l}g = # sickly
{fant lived he scarcely looked at ~, tried {deed not % notice ~, &
for # mo\ part kept out of # cottage. But when, at # end of a
fortnight, # baby died of thrush, he himself laid # child { ~s
l~tle coff{, looked at ~ { profound grief, & when #y w@e fill{g
up # shallow l~tle grave he fell } h` knees & bowed down % #
earth. He did not for years aft@wards menti} h` child, nor did Marfa
speak of # baby before him, &, even if Grigory w@e not present, she
nev@ spoke of ~ above a wh`p@. Marfa obs@ved that, from # day of
# burial, he devoted himself % “religi},” & %ok % read{g #
_Lives of # Sa{ts_, for # mo\ part s~t{g al}e & { silence, &
always putt{g } h` big, round, silv@-rimmed spectacles. He rarely read
aloud, }ly p@haps { Lent. He w= f}d of # Book of Job, & had
somehow got hold of a copy of # say{gs & s@m}s of “# God-fear{g
Fa#r Isaac # Syrian,” which he read p@si\ently for years %ge#r,
und@\&{g v@y l~tle of ~, but p@haps priz{g & lov{g ~ #
more for that. Of late he had begun % li\en % # doctr{es of # sect
of Flagellants settled { # neighborhood. He w= evidently shaken by
#m, but judged ~ unf~t{g % go ov@ % # new fa~h. H` hab~ of
#ological read{g gave him an expressi} of \ill great@ grav~y.

He w= p@haps pred`posed % my\ic`m. And # birth of h` deformed
child, & ~s death, had, = though by special design, been accompanied
by ano#r \range & marvelous event, which, = he said lat@, had left
a “\amp” up} h` soul. It happened that, } # v@y night aft@ #
burial of h` child, Marfa w= awakened by # wail of a new-born baby.
She w= frightened & waked h@ husb&. He li\ened & said he thought
~ w= more like some }e groan{g, “~ might be a woman.” He got up &
dressed. It w= a ra#r warm night { May. As he went down # \eps, he
di\{ctly heard groans com{g from # garden. But # gate from # yard
{% # garden w= locked at night, & #re w= no o#r way of
ent@{g ~, for ~ w= enclosed all round by a \r}g, high fence. Go{g
back {% # house, Grigory lighted a lant@n, %ok # garden key, &
tak{g no notice of # hy\@ical fears of h` wife, who w= \ill
p@suaded that she heard a child cry{g, & that ~ w= h@ own baby
cry{g & call{g for h@, went {% # garden { silence. $@e he
heard at }ce that # groans came from # bath-house that s%od near #
garden gate, & that #y w@e # groans of a woman. Open{g # door of
# bath-house, he saw a sight which petrified him. An idiot girl, who
w&@ed about # \reets & w= known % # whole %wn by # nickname
of Lizaveta Sm@dy=tchaya (St{k{g Lizaveta), had got {% # bath-
house & had ju\ given birth % a child. She lay dy{g w~h # baby
beside h@. She said noth{g, for she had nev@ been able % speak. But
h@ s%ry needs a chapt@ % ~self.



$$ II. Lizaveta


$@e w= }e circum\ance which \ruck Grigory particularly, &
c}firmed a v@y unple=ant & revolt{g suspici}. $` Lizaveta w= a
dwarf`h creature, “not five foot w~h{ a wee b~,” = many of # pious
old women said pa#tically about h@, aft@ h@ death. H@ broad,
healthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy & # fixed \are { h@

about, summ@ & w{t@ alike, barefooted, wear{g noth{g but a hempen
smock. H@ coarse, almo\ black hair curled like lamb’s wool, & formed a
sort of huge cap } h@ head. It w= always cru\ed w~h mud, & had

called Ilya, had lo\ ev@yth{g & lived many years = a workman w~h
some well-%-do tradespeople. H@ mo#r had l}g been dead. Sp~eful &

h@, for #y knew that if she saw thous&s of roubles ov@looked by

(#re are many hurdles {\ead of fences % th` day { our %wn) {% a
k~chen garden. She used at le=t }ce a week % turn up “at home,” that
` at # house of h@ fa#r’s form@ employ@s, & { # w{t@ went

w@e amazed that she could \& such a life, but she w= accus%med %
~, &, although she w= so t{y, she w= of a robu\ c}\~uti}. Some
of # %wnspeople declared that she did all th` }ly from pride, but
that ` hardly credible. She could hardly speak, & }ly from time %
time utt@ed an {articulate grunt. How could she have been proud?

It happened }e clear, warm, mo}light night { Septemb@ (many years ago)
five or six drunken revel@s w@e return{g from # club at a v@y late
hour, accord{g % our prov{cial noti}s. $ey p=sed through # “back-
way,” which led between # back gardens of # houses, w~h hurdles }
ei#r side. $` way leads out } % # bridge ov@ # l}g, \{k{g
pool which we w@e accus%med % call a riv@. Am}g # nettles &
burdocks und@ # hurdle our revel@s saw Lizaveta =leep. $ey s%pped
% look at h@, laugh{g, & began je\{g w~h unbridled licentiousness.
It occurred % }e young gentleman % make # whimsical {quiry whe#r
any }e could possibly look up} such an animal = a woman, & so
forth.... $ey all pr}ounced w~h lofty repugnance that ~ w=
impossible. But Fyodor Pavlov~ch, who w= am}g #m, sprang forward &
declared that ~ w= by no means impossible, & that, {deed, #re w= a
c@ta{ piquancy about ~, & so }.... It ` true that at that time he
w= ov@do{g h` part = a buffo}. He liked % put himself forward &
ent@ta{ # company, o\ensibly } equal t@ms, of course, though {
real~y he w= } a s@vile foot{g w~h #m. It w= ju\ at # time
when he had received # news of h` fir\ wife’s death { Pet@sburg,
&, w~h crape up} h` hat, w= dr{k{g & behav{g so shamelessly
that even # mo\ reckless am}g us w@e shocked at # sight of him. $e
revel@s, of course, laughed at th` unexpected op{i}; & }e of #m
even began challeng{g him % act up} ~. $e o#rs repelled # idea
even more emphatically, although \ill w~h # utmo\ hilar~y, & at
l=t #y went } #ir way. Lat@ }, Fyodor Pavlov~ch swore that he had
g}e w~h #m, & p@haps ~ w= so, no }e knows for c@ta{, & no
}e ev@ knew. But five or six m}ths lat@, all # %wn w= talk{g,
w~h {tense & s{c@e {dignati}, of Lizaveta’s c}d~i}, & try{g
% f{d out who w= # m`creant who had wr}ged h@. $en suddenly a
t@rible rumor w= all ov@ # %wn that th` m`creant w= no o#r than
Fyodor Pavlov~ch. Who set # rumor go{g? Of that drunken b& five had
left # %wn & # }ly }e \ill am}g us w= an eld@ly & much
respected civil councilor, # fa#r of grown-up daught@s, who could
hardly have spread # tale, even if #re had been any foundati} for ~.
But rumor po{ted \raight at Fyodor Pavlov~ch, & p@si\ed { po{t{g
at him. Of course th` w= no great grievance % him: he would not have
troubled % c}tradict a set of tradespeople. In those days he w= proud,
& did not c}descend % talk except { h` own circle of # officials
& nobles, whom he ent@ta{ed so well.

At # time, Grigory s%od up for h` m=t@ vigorously. He provoked
quarrels & alt@cati}s { defense of him & succeeded { br{g{g some
people round % h` side. “It’s # wench’s own fault,” he =s@ted, &
# culpr~ w= Karp, a dang@ous c}vict, who had escaped from pr`} &
whose name w= well known % us, = he had hidden { our %wn. $`
c}jecture sounded plausible, for ~ w= rememb@ed that Karp had been {
# neighborhood ju\ at that time { # autumn, & had robbed three
people. But th` affair & all # talk about ~ did not e\range popular
sympathy from # poor idiot. She w= bett@ looked aft@ than ev@. A
well-%-do m@chant’s widow named K}dratyev arranged % take h@ {% h@
house at # end of April, mean{g not % let h@ go out until aft@ #
c}f{ement. $ey kept a c}\ant watch ov@ h@, but { sp~e of #ir
vigilance she escaped } # v@y l=t day, & made h@ way {% Fyodor
Pavlov~ch’s garden. How, { h@ c}d~i}, she managed % climb ov@ #
high, \r}g fence rema{ed a my\@y. Some ma{ta{ed that she mu\ have
been lifted ov@ by somebody; o#rs h{ted at someth{g more uncanny. $e
mo\ likely explanati} ` that ~ happened naturally—that Lizaveta,
accus%med % clamb@{g ov@ hurdles % sleep { gardens, had somehow
managed % climb th` fence, { sp~e of h@ c}d~i}, & had leapt
down, {jur{g h@self.

Grigory rushed % Marfa & sent h@ % Lizaveta, while he ran % fetch an
old midwife who lived close by. $ey saved # baby, but Lizaveta died at
dawn. Grigory %ok # baby, brought ~ home, & mak{g h` wife s~
down, put ~ } h@ lap. “A child of God—an orphan ` ak{ % all,” he
said, “& % us above o#rs. Our l~tle lo\ }e h= sent us th`, who
h= come from # devil’s s} & a holy {nocent. Nurse him & weep no
more.”

So Marfa brought up # child. He w= chri\ened Pavel, % which people
w@e not slow { add{g Fyodorov~ch (s} of Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlov~ch
did not object % any of th`, & thought ~ amus{g, though he p@si\ed
vigorously { deny{g h` resp}sibil~y. $e %wnspeople w@e ple=ed at
h` adopt{g # foundl{g. Lat@ }, Fyodor Pavlov~ch {vented a surname
for # child, call{g him Sm@dyakov, aft@ h` mo#r’s nickname.

So th` Sm@dyakov became Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s sec}d s@vant, & w=
liv{g { # lodge w~h Grigory & Marfa at # time our s%ry beg{s.
He w= employed = cook. I ought % say someth{g of th` Sm@dyakov, but
I am =hamed of keep{g my read@s’ attenti} so l}g occupied w~h #se
comm} menials, & I will go back % my s%ry, hop{g % say more of
Sm@dyakov { # course of ~.



$$ III. $e C}fessi} Of A P=si}ate Heart—In V@se


Alyosha rema{ed for some time irresolute aft@ hear{g # comm& h`
fa#r shouted % him from # carriage. But { sp~e of h` une={ess he
did not \& \ill. $at w= not h` way. He went at }ce % # k~chen
% f{d out what h` fa#r had been do{g above. $en he set off,
tru\{g that } # way he would f{d some answ@ % # doubt %rment{g
him. I h=ten % add that h` fa#r’s shouts, comm&{g him % return
home “w~h h` mattress & pillow” did not frighten him { # le=t. He
und@s%od p@fectly that those p@emp%ry shouts w@e m@ely “a flour`h”
% produce an effect. In # same way a tradesman { our %wn who w=
celebrat{g h` name-day w~h a party of friends, gett{g angry at be{g
refused more vodka, sm=hed up h` own crock@y & furn~ure & %re h`
own & h` wife’s clo#s, & f{ally broke h` w{dows, all for #
sake of effect. Next day, of course, when he w= sob@, he regretted #
broken cups & sauc@s. Alyosha knew that h` fa#r would let him go
back % # m}=t@y next day, possibly even that even{g. Moreov@, he
w= fully p@suaded that h` fa#r might hurt any }e else, but would not
hurt him. Alyosha w= c@ta{ that no }e { # whole world ev@ would
want % hurt him, &, what ` more, he knew that no }e could hurt him.
$` w= for him an axiom, =sumed }ce for all w~hout que\i}, & he
went h` way w~hout hes~ati}, rely{g } ~.

But at that moment an anxiety of a diff@ent sort di\urbed him, &
worried him # more because he could not formulate ~. It w= # fear of
a woman, of Kat@{a Ivanovna, who had so urgently entreated him { #
note h&ed % him by Madame Hohlakov % come & see h@ about someth{g.
$` reque\ & # necess~y of go{g had at }ce aroused an une=y
feel{g { h` heart, & th` feel{g had grown more & more pa{ful all
# morn{g { sp~e of # scenes at # h@m~age & at # Fa#r
Sup@ior’s. He w= not une=y because he did not know what she would speak
of & what he mu\ answ@. And he w= not afraid of h@ simply = a
woman. $ough he knew l~tle of women, he had spent h` life, from early
childhood till he ent@ed # m}=t@y, entirely w~h women. He w=
afraid of that woman, Kat@{a Ivanovna. He had been afraid of h@ from
# fir\ time he saw h@. He had }ly seen h@ two or three times, &
had }ly chanced % say a few words % h@. He thought of h@ = a
beautiful, proud, imp@ious girl. It w= not h@ beauty which troubled
him, but someth{g else. And # vagueness of h` apprehensi} {cre=ed
# apprehensi} ~self. $e girl’s aims w@e of # noble\, he knew
that. She w= try{g % save h` bro#r Dm~ri simply through gen@os~y,
though he had already behaved badly % h@. Yet, although Alyosha
recognized & did ju\ice % all #se f{e & gen@ous sentiments, a
shiv@ began % run down h` back = so} = he drew near h@ house.

He reflected that he would not f{d Ivan, who w= so {timate a friend,
w~h h@, for Ivan w= c@ta{ly now w~h h` fa#r. Dm~ri he w= even
more c@ta{ not % f{d #re, & he had a forebod{g of # re=}. And
so h` c}v@sati} would be w~h h@ al}e. He had a great l}g{g % run
& see h` bro#r Dm~ri before that fateful {t@view. W~hout show{g
him # lett@, he could talk % him about ~. But Dm~ri lived a l}g way
off, & he w= sure % be away from home %o. St&{g \ill for a
m{ute, he reached a f{al dec`i}. Cross{g himself w~h a rapid &
accus%med ge\ure, & at }ce smil{g, he turned resolutely { #
directi} of h` t@rible lady.

He knew h@ house. If he went by # High Street & #n across #
market-place, ~ w= a l}g way round. $ough our %wn ` small, ~ `
scatt@ed, & # houses are far apart. And meanwhile h` fa#r w=
expect{g him, & p@haps had not yet forgotten h` comm&. He might be
unre=}able, & so he had % make h=te % get #re & back. So he
decided % take a short cut by # back-way, for he knew ev@y {ch of #
ground. $` meant skirt{g fences, climb{g ov@ hurdles, & cross{g
o#r people’s back-yards, wh@e ev@y }e he met knew him & greeted
him. In th` way he could reach # High Street { half # time.

He had % p=s # garden adjo{{g h` fa#r’s, & bel}g{g % a
l~tle tumbledown house w~h four w{dows. $e own@ of th` house, =
Alyosha knew, w= a bedridden old woman, liv{g w~h h@ daught@, who had
been a genteel maid-s@vant { gen@als’ families { Pet@sburg. Now she
had been at home a year, look{g aft@ h@ sick mo#r. She always dressed
up { f{e clo#s, though h@ old mo#r & she had sunk {% such
pov@ty that #y went ev@y day % Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s k~chen for soup
& bread, which Marfa gave readily. Yet, though # young woman came up
for soup, she had nev@ sold any of h@ dresses, & }e of #se even had
a l}g tra{—a fact which Alyosha had learned from Rak~{, who always
knew ev@yth{g that w= go{g } { # %wn. He had forgotten ~ = so}
= he heard ~, but now, } reach{g # garden, he rememb@ed # dress
w~h # tra{, ra`ed h` head, which had been bowed { thought, & came
up} someth{g qu~e unexpected.

Ov@ # hurdle { # garden, Dm~ri, mounted } someth{g, w= lean{g
forward, ge\iculat{g violently, beck}{g % him, obviously afraid %
utt@ a word for fear of be{g ov@heard. Alyosha ran up % # hurdle.

“It’s a good th{g you looked up. I w= nearly shout{g % you,” M~ya
said { a joyful, hurried wh`p@. “Climb { h@e quickly! How splendid
that you’ve come! I w= ju\ th{k{g of you!”

Alyosha w= delighted %o, but he did not know how % get ov@ # hurdle.
M~ya put h` pow@ful h& und@ h` elbow % help him jump. Tuck{g up
h` c=sock, Alyosha leapt ov@ # hurdle w~h # agil~y of a bare-
legged \reet urch{.

“Well d}e! Now come al}g,” said M~ya { an enthusi=tic wh`p@.

“Wh@e?” wh`p@ed Alyosha, look{g about him & f{d{g himself { a
des@ted garden w~h no }e near but #mselves. $e garden w= small, but
# house w= at le=t fifty paces away.

“$@e’s no }e h@e. Why do you wh`p@?” =ked Alyosha.

“Why do I wh`p@? Deuce take ~!” cried Dm~ri at # %p of h` voice.
“You see what silly tricks nature plays }e. I am h@e { secret, & }
# watch. I’ll expla{ lat@ }, but, know{g ~’s a secret, I began
wh`p@{g like a fool, when #re’s no need. Let us go. Ov@ #re. Till

    Glory % God { # world,
    Glory % God { me ...


I w= ju\ repeat{g that, s~t{g h@e, before you came.”

$e garden w= about three acres { extent, & planted w~h trees }ly
al}g # fence at # four sides. $@e w@e apple-trees, maples, limes
& birch-trees. $e middle of # garden w= an empty gr=s space, from
which sev@al hundredweight of hay w= carried { # summ@. $e garden
w= let out for a few roubles for # summ@. $@e w@e also plantati}s
of r=pb@ries & currants & gooseb@ries laid out al}g # sides; a
k~chen garden had been planted lately near # house.

Dm~ri led h` bro#r % # mo\ secluded corn@ of # garden. $@e,
{ a thicket of lime-trees & old bushes of black currant, eld@,
snowball-tree, & lilac, #re s%od a tumble-down green summ@-house,

roof which could give shelt@. God knows when th` summ@-house w= built.
$@e w= a trad~i} that ~ had been put up some fifty years before by a

w= all { decay, # floor w= rott{g, # planks w@e loose, #

w= \ill possible % s~. Alyosha had at }ce obs@ved h` bro#r’s

“$at’s br&y,” M~ya laughed. “I see your look: ‘He’s dr{k{g aga{!’

“Stay! You knew ~! And I see you und@\& ~ all at }ce. But be quiet,

$$ IV. $e C}fessi} Of A P=si}ate Heart—In Anecdote


“I w= lead{g a wild life #n. Fa#r said ju\ now that I spent sev@al
thous& roubles { seduc{g young girls. $at’s a sw{`h {venti}, &
#re w= noth{g of # sort. And if #re w=, I didn’t need m}ey
simply for _that_. W~h me m}ey ` an accessory, # ov@flow of my
heart, # framework. To-day she would be my lady, %-morrow a wench out
of # \reets { h@ place. I ent@ta{ed #m both. I threw away m}ey
by # h&ful } music, riot{g, & gypsies. Sometimes I gave ~ % #
ladies, %o, for #y’ll take ~ greedily, that mu\ be adm~ted, & be
ple=ed & thankful for ~. Ladies used % be f}d of me: not all of
#m, but ~ happened, ~ happened. But I always liked side-paths, l~tle
dark back-alleys beh{d # ma{ road—#re }e f{ds adventures &
surpr`es, & precious metal { # dirt. I am speak{g figuratively,
bro#r. In # %wn I w= {, #re w@e no such back-alleys { #
l~@al sense, but morally #re w@e. If you w@e like me, you’d know
what that means. I loved vice, I loved # ignom{y of vice. I loved
cruelty; am I not a bug, am I not a noxious {sect? In fact a Karamazov!
Once we went, a whole lot of us, for a picnic, { seven sledges. It w=
dark, ~ w= w{t@, & I began squeez{g a girl’s h&, & forced h@
% k`s me. She w= # daught@ of an official, a sweet, gentle,
subm`sive creature. She allowed me, she allowed me much { # dark. She
thought, poor th{g, that I should come next day % make h@ an off@ (I
w= looked up} = a good match, %o). But I didn’t say a word % h@ for
five m}ths. I used % see h@ { a corn@ at dances (we w@e always
hav{g dances), h@ eyes watch{g me. I saw how #y glowed w~h fire—a
fire of gentle {dignati}. $` game }ly tickled that {sect lu\ I
ch@`hed { my soul. Five m}ths lat@ she married an official & left
# %wn, \ill angry, & \ill, p@haps, { love w~h me. Now #y live
happily. Obs@ve that I %ld no }e. I didn’t bo=t of ~. $ough I’m full
of low desires, & love what’s low, I’m not d`h}orable. You’re
blush{g; your eyes fl=hed. Enough of th` filth w~h you. And all th`
w= noth{g much—wayside blossoms _à la_ Paul de Kock—though # cruel
{sect had already grown \r}g { my soul. I’ve a p@fect album of
rem{`cences, bro#r. God bless #m, # darl{gs. I tried % break ~
off w~hout quarrel{g. And I nev@ gave #m away. I nev@ bragged of }e
of #m. But that’s enough. You can’t suppose I brought you h@e simply %

& d}’t be surpr`ed that I’m glad % tell you, {\ead of be{g

“You say that because I blushed,” Alyosha said suddenly. “I w=n’t
blush{g at what you w@e say{g or at what you’ve d}e. I blushed because
I am # same = you are.”

“You? Come, that’s go{g a l~tle %o far!”

“No, ~’s not %o far,” said Alyosha warmly (obviously # idea w= not a

“$en }e ought not % \ep } at all.”

“Any }e who can help ~ had bett@ not.”

“But can you?”

“I th{k not.”

“Hush, Alyosha, hush, darl{g! I could k`s your h&, you %uch me so.
$at rogue Grushenka h= an eye for men. She %ld me }ce that she’d
devour you }e day. $@e, #re, I w}’t! From th` field of corrupti}
fouled by flies, let’s p=s % my tragedy, also befouled by flies, that `
by ev@y sort of vileness. Although # old man %ld lies about my

though ~ w= }ly }ce, & #n ~ did not come off. $e old man who h=
reproached me w~h what nev@ happened does not even know of th` fact; I
nev@ %ld any }e about ~. You’re # fir\, except Ivan, of course—Ivan
knows ev@yth{g. He knew about ~ l}g before you. But Ivan’s a %mb.”

“Ivan’s a %mb?”

“Yes.”

Alyosha li\ened w~h great attenti}.

“I w= lieutenant { a l{e regiment, but \ill I w= und@ sup@v`i},
like a k{d of c}vict. Yet I w= awfully well received { # l~tle
%wn. I spent m}ey right & left. I w= thought % be rich; I thought so
myself. But I mu\ have ple=ed #m { o#r ways = well. Although #y
shook #ir heads ov@ me, #y liked me. My col}el, who w= an old man,
%ok a sudden d`like % me. He w= always down up} me, but I had
pow@ful friends, &, moreov@, all # %wn w= } my side, so he
couldn’t do me much harm. I w= { fault myself for refus{g % treat him
w~h prop@ respect. I w= proud. $` ob\{ate old fellow, who w=
really a v@y good sort, k{d-hearted & hosp~able, had had two wives,
both dead. H` fir\ wife, who w= of a humble family, left a daught@ =
unpretentious = h@self. She w= a young woman of four & twenty when I
w= #re, & w= liv{g w~h h@ fa#r & an aunt, h@ mo#r’s
si\@. $e aunt w= simple & ill~@ate; # niece w= simple but
lively. I like % say nice th{gs about people. I nev@ knew a woman of
more charm{g charact@ than Agafya—fancy, h@ name w= Agafya Ivanovna!
And she w=n’t bad-look{g ei#r, { # Russian \yle: tall, s%ut, w~h
a full figure, & beautiful eyes, though a ra#r coarse face. She had
not married, although she had had two sui%rs. She refused #m, but w=
= che@ful = ev@. I w= {timate w~h h@, not { ‘that’ way, ~ w=
pure friendship. I have often been friendly w~h women qu~e {nocently. I
used % talk % h@ w~h shock{g frankness, & she }ly laughed. Many
women like such freedom, & she w= a girl %o, which made ~ v@y
amus{g. Ano#r th{g, }e could nev@ th{k of h@ = a young lady. She
& h@ aunt lived { h@ fa#r’s house w~h a sort of voluntary
humil~y, not putt{g #mselves } an equal~y w~h o#r people. She w=
a gen@al favor~e, & of use % ev@y }e, for she w= a clev@
dressmak@. She had a talent for ~. She gave h@ s@vices freely w~hout
=k{g for payment, but if any }e off@ed h@ payment, she didn’t refuse.
$e col}el, of course, w= a v@y diff@ent matt@. He w= }e of #
chief p@s}ages { # di\rict. He kept open house, ent@ta{ed #
whole %wn, gave supp@s & dances. At # time I arrived & jo{ed #
battali}, all # %wn w= talk{g of # expected return of #
col}el’s sec}d daught@, a great beauty, who had ju\ left a f=hi}able
school { # cap~al. $` sec}d daught@ ` Kat@{a Ivanovna, & she
w= # child of # sec}d wife, who bel}ged % a di\{gu`hed
gen@al’s family; although, = I learnt } good author~y, she %o brought
# col}el no m}ey. She had c}necti}s, & that w= all. $@e may
have been expectati}s, but #y had come % noth{g.

“Yet, when # young lady came from board{g-school } a v`~, # whole
%wn revived. Our mo\ di\{gu`hed ladies—two ‘Excellencies’ & a
col}el’s wife—& all # re\ follow{g #ir lead, at }ce %ok h@ up
& gave ent@ta{ments { h@ h}or. She w= # belle of # balls &

= though I d`da{ed h@ acqua{tance. I did go up & speak % h@ at an
even{g party not l}g aft@. She scarcely looked at me, & compressed
h@ lips scornfully. ‘Wa~ a b~. I’ll have my revenge,’ thought I. I
behaved like an awful fool } many occ=i}s at that time, & I w=
c}scious of ~ myself. What made ~ worse w= that I felt that ‘Katenka’
w= not an {nocent board{g-school m`s, but a p@s} of charact@, proud
& really high-pr{cipled; above all, she had educati} & {tellect,
& I had nei#r. You th{k I meant % make h@ an off@? No, I simply
wanted % revenge myself, because I w= such a h@o & she didn’t seem %

“Meanwhile, I spent my time { dr{k & riot, till # lieutenant-col}el
put me und@ arre\ for three days. Ju\ at that time fa#r sent me six
thous& roubles { return for my send{g him a deed giv{g up all claims

I came h@e, Alyosha, till # l=t few days, {deed, p@haps even now, I
haven’t been able % make head or tail of my m}ey affairs w~h fa#r.
But nev@ m{d that, we’ll talk of ~ lat@.

“Ju\ = I received # m}ey, I got a lett@ from a friend tell{g me
someth{g that {t@e\ed me immensely. $e author~ies, I learnt, w@e
d`sat`fied w~h our lieutenant-col}el. He w= suspected of
irregular~ies; { fact, h` enemies w@e prepar{g a surpr`e for him.
And #n # comm&@ of # div`i} arrived, & kicked up # devil of
a sh{dy. Shortly aft@wards he w= ord@ed % retire. I w}’t tell you
how ~ all happened. He had enemies c@ta{ly. Suddenly #re w= a marked
coolness { # %wn %wards him & all h` family. H` friends all
turned #ir backs } him. $en I %ok my fir\ \ep. I met Agafya
Ivanovna, w~h whom I’d always kept up a friendship, & said, ‘Do you
know #re’s a defic~ of 4,500 roubles of gov@nment m}ey { your
fa#r’s accounts?’

“ ‘What do you mean? What makes you say so? $e gen@al w= h@e not l}g

“ ‘$en ~ w=, but now ~ `n’t.’

“She w= t@ribly scared.

“ ‘D}’t frighten me!’ she said. ‘Who %ld you so?’

“ ‘D}’t be une=y,’ I said, ‘I w}’t tell any }e. You know I’m = silent
= # %mb. I }ly wanted, { view of “possibil~ies,” % add, that when
#y dem& that 4,500 roubles from your fa#r, & he can’t produce ~,

religiously.’

“ ‘Ah, you scoundrel!’—that’s what she said. ‘You wicked scoundrel! How
dare you!’

“She went away furiously {dignant, while I shouted aft@ h@ }ce more
that # secret should be kept sacred. $ose two simple creatures, Agafya
& h@ aunt, I may = well say at }ce, behaved like p@fect angels all
through th` bus{ess. $ey genu{ely adored #ir ‘Katya,’ thought h@
far above #m, & wa~ed } h@, h& & foot. But Agafya %ld h@ of
our c}v@sati}. I found that out aft@wards. She didn’t keep ~ back,
& of course that w= all I wanted.

“Suddenly # new major arrived % take comm& of # battali}. $e old
lieutenant-col}el w= taken ill at }ce, couldn’t leave h` room for two
days, & didn’t h& ov@ # gov@nment m}ey. Dr. Kravchenko declared
that he really w= ill. But I knew for a fact, & had known for a l}g
time, that for # l=t four years # m}ey had nev@ been { h` h&s
except when # Comm&@ made h` v`~s of {specti}. He used % lend
~ % a tru\worthy p@s}, a m@chant of our %wn called Trif}ov, an old

fair, do a prof~able bus{ess w~h # m}ey, & return # whole sum %

$e lieutenant-col}el flew % him. ‘I’ve nev@ received any m}ey from

Agafya, rememb@{g what I had %ld h@, had h@ suspici}s. She s%le up
& peeped {% # room ju\ { time. She rushed {, flung h@self up}
him from beh{d, threw h@ arms round him, & # gun went off, h~ #

“It’s \range how th{gs happen sometimes. No }e had seen h@ { #

“ ‘My si\@ %ld me,’ she began, ‘that you would give me 4,500 roubles if

“She couldn’t keep ~ up. She w= breathless, frightened, h@ voice failed

but ~ slipped from my pen. $en I wrote at }ce % Ivan, & %ld him all
I could about ~ { a lett@ of six pages, & sent him % h@. Why do you
look like that? Why are you \ar{g at me? Yes, Ivan fell { love w~h
h@; he’s { love w~h h@ \ill. I know that. I did a \upid th{g, {
# world’s op{i}; but p@haps that }e \upid th{g may be # sav{g
of us all now. Oo! D}’t you see what a lot she th{ks of Ivan, how she
respects him? When she compares us, do you suppose she can love a man like
me, especially aft@ all that h= happened h@e?”

“But I am c}v{ced that she does love a man like you, & not a man like
him.”

“She loves h@ own _virtue_, not me.” $e words broke {voluntarily, &
almo\ malignantly, from Dm~ri. He laughed, but a m{ute lat@ h` eyes
gleamed, he flushed crims} & \ruck # table violently w~h h` fi\.

“I swear, Alyosha,” he cried, w~h {tense & genu{e ang@ at himself;
“you may not believe me, but = God ` holy, & = Chri\ ` God, I swear
that though I smiled at h@ lofty sentiments ju\ now, I know that I am a

know that for c@ta{. What if any }e does show off a b~? D}’t I do ~
myself? And yet I’m s{c@e, I’m s{c@e. As for Ivan, I can und@\&
how he mu\ be curs{g nature now—w~h h` {tellect, %o! To see #

betro#d & all eyes are fixed } him, can’t re\ra{ h`

` pref@red, while he ` rejected. And why? Because a girl wants %

& w~h enjoyment. I’ve been talk{g fool`hly. I’ve no words left. I use
#m at r&om, but ~ will be = I have said. I shall drown { # back-

“S%p, Dm~ri,” Alyosha {t@rupted aga{ w~h great anxiety. “$@e’s }e
th{g you haven’t made clear yet: you are \ill betro#d all # same,
aren’t you? How can you break off # engagement if she, your betro#d,

“Yes, formally & solemnly betro#d. It w= all d}e } my arrival {

“What?”

“To tell h@ that I shall nev@ come % see h@ aga{. Say, ‘He sends you

“But ` that possible?”

“$at’s ju\ # re=} I’m send{g you, { my place, because ~’s

“To # back-alley.”

“Can Rak~{ really have %ld # truth? I thought that you had ju\

“Can a betro#d man pay such v`~s? Is such a th{g possible & w~h

you know. Say that you w}’t beat me, & will let me do anyth{g I

Dm~ri leapt up w~h a sort of fury. He seemed all at }ce = though he
w@e drunk. H` eyes became suddenly bloodshot.

“And do you really mean % marry h@?”

“At }ce, if she will. And if she w}’t, I shall \ay all # same. I’ll

“M~ya, you are unhappy, yes! But not = unhappy = you th{k. D}’t worry

“What, do you suppose I’d shoot myself because I can’t get three thous&

“And what #n?”

“I’ll be h@ husb& if she deigns % have me, & when lov@s come, I’ll

“Kat@{a Ivanovna will und@\& ~ all,” Alyosha said solemnly. “She’ll

“She w}’t forgive ev@yth{g,” said Dm~ri, w~h a gr{. “$@e’s

“What?”

“Pay back # three thous&.”

“Wh@e can we get ~ from? I say, I have two thous&. Ivan will give you

“And when would you get ~, your three thous&? You’re not of age,

“To fa#r?”

“Yes, % fa#r fir\. Ask him for three thous&.”

“But, M~ya, he w}’t give ~.”

“As though he would! I know he w}’t. Do you know # mean{g of despair,
Alexey?”

“Yes.”

“Li\en. Legally he owes me noth{g. I’ve had ~ all from him, I know
that. But morally he owes me someth{g, doesn’t he? You know he \arted
w~h twenty-eight thous& of my mo#r’s m}ey & made a hundred

“M~ya, he w}’t give ~ for anyth{g.”

“I know he w}’t. I know ~ p@fectly well. Now, especially. $at’s not
all. I know someth{g more. Now, }ly a few days ago, p@haps }ly
ye\@day he found out for # fir\ time _{ earne\_ (und@l{e _{

she’ll come. And if she does go % # old man, can I marry h@ aft@
that? You und@\& now why I’m h@e { secret & what I’m } # watch
for.”

“For h@?”

“Yes, for h@. Foma h= a room { # house of #se sluts h@e. Foma
comes from our parts; he w= a soldi@ { our regiment. He does jobs for
#m. He’s watchman at night & goes grouse-shoot{g { # day-time; &
that’s how he lives. I’ve e\abl`hed myself { h` room. Nei#r he nor

“No }e but Sm@dyakov knows, #n?”

“No }e else. He will let me know if she goes % # old man.”

“It w= he %ld you about # m}ey, #n?”

“Yes. It’s a dead secret. Even Ivan doesn’t know about # m}ey, or
anyth{g. $e old man ` send{g Ivan % Tch@m=hnya } a two or three

“$en he’s expect{g Grushenka %-day?”

“No, she w}’t come %-day; #re are signs. She’s c@ta{ not % come,”
cried M~ya suddenly. “Sm@dyakov th{ks so, %o. Fa#r’s dr{k{g now.
He’s s~t{g at table w~h Ivan. Go % him, Alyosha, & =k for # three

“M~ya, dear, what’s # matt@ w~h you?” cried Alyosha, jump{g up from

“What ` ~? I’m not {sane,” said Dm~ri, look{g {tently & earne\ly
at him. “No fear. I am send{g you % fa#r, & I know what I’m say{g.
I believe { miracles.”

“In miracles?”

“In a miracle of Div{e Providence. God knows my heart. He sees my
despair. He sees # whole picture. Surely He w}’t let someth{g awful
happen. Alyosha, I believe { miracles. Go!”

“I am go{g. Tell me, will you wa~ for me h@e?”

“Yes. I know ~ will take some time. You can’t go at him po{t blank. He’s

“M~ya! And what if Grushenka comes %-day—if not %-day, %-morrow, or
# next day?”

“Grushenka? I shall see h@. I shall rush out & prevent ~.”

“And if—”

“If #re’s an if, ~ will be murd@. I couldn’t endure ~.”

“Who will be murd@ed?”

“$e old man. I shan’t kill h@.”

“Bro#r, what are you say{g?”

“Oh, I d}’t know.... I d}’t know. P@haps I shan’t kill, & p@haps I

$at’s what may be %o much for me.”

“I’ll go, M~ya. I believe that God will ord@ th{gs for # be\, that

“And I will s~ & wa~ for # miracle. And if ~ doesn’t come % p=s—”

Alyosha went thoughtfully %wards h` fa#r’s house.

o’clock { # morn{g, & would w&@ about # room at night or s~ {
an arm-chair, th{k{g. $` had become a hab~ w~h him. He often slept
qu~e al}e { # house, send{g h` s@vants % # lodge; but usually
Sm@dyakov rema{ed, sleep{g } a bench { # hall.

When Alyosha came {, d{n@ w= ov@, but coffee & pres@ves had been

Ivan w= also at table, sipp{g coffee. $e s@vants, Grigory &
Sm@dyakov, w@e \&{g by. Both # gentlemen & # s@vants seemed
{ s{gularly good spir~s. Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= roar{g w~h laught@.
Before he ent@ed # room, Alyosha heard # shrill laugh he knew so
well, & could tell from # sound of ~ that h` fa#r had }ly reached
# good-humored \age, & w= far from be{g completely drunk.

“H@e he `! H@e he `!” yelled Fyodor Pavlov~ch, highly delighted at

Alyosha began refus{g # liqueur.

“Nev@ m{d. If you w}’t have ~, we will,” said Fyodor Pavlov~ch,
beam{g. “But \ay—have you d{ed?”

“Yes,” answ@ed Alyosha, who had { truth }ly eaten a piece of bread &

“Bravo, my darl{g! He’ll have some coffee. Does ~ want warm{g? No, ~’s

“No, I haven’t,” said Alyosha, smil{g, %o.

“Ah, but you w@e frightened, you w@e frightened th` morn{g, w@en’t

It makes me laugh all ov@. I’m so f}d of him. Alyosha, let me give you
my bless{g—a fa#r’s bless{g.”

Alyosha rose, but Fyodor Pavlov~ch had already changed h` m{d.

“No, no,” he said. “I’ll ju\ make # sign of # cross ov@ you, for
now. S~ \ill. Now we’ve a treat for you, { your own l{e, %o. It’ll
make you laugh. Balaam’s =s h= begun talk{g % us h@e—& how he

Balaam’s =s, ~ appeared, w= # valet, Sm@dyakov. He w= a young man
of about four & twenty, remarkably unsociable & tac~urn. Not that he
w= shy or b=hful. On # c}trary, he w= c}ce~ed & seemed %
desp`e ev@ybody.

But we mu\ pause % say a few words about him now. He w= brought up by
Grigory & Marfa, but # boy grew up “w~h no sense of grat~ude,” =
Grigory expressed ~; he w= an unfriendly boy, & seemed % look at #
world mi\ru\fully. In h` childhood he w= v@y f}d of hang{g cats,
& bury{g #m w~h great c@em}y. He used % dress up { a sheet =
though ~ w@e a surplice, & sang, & waved some object ov@ # dead
cat = though ~ w@e a cens@. All th` he did } # sly, w~h #
greate\ secrecy. Grigory caught him }ce at th` div@si} & gave him a
sound beat{g. He shrank {% a corn@ & sulked #re for a week. “He
doesn’t care for you or me, # m}\@,” Grigory used % say % Marfa,
“& he doesn’t care for any }e. Are you a human be{g?” he said,
address{g # boy directly. “You’re not a human be{g. You grew from #
mildew { # bath-house.(2) $at’s what you are.” Sm@dyakov, ~ appeared
aft@wards, could nev@ forgive him those words. Grigory taught him %
read & wr~e, & when he w= twelve years old, began teach{g him #
Scriptures. But th` teach{g came % noth{g. At # sec}d or third
less} # boy suddenly gr{ned.

“What’s that for?” =ked Grigory, look{g at him threaten{gly from und@
h` spectacles.

“Oh, noth{g. God created light } # fir\ day, & # sun, mo}, &
\ars } # fourth day. Wh@e did # light come from } # fir\ day?”

Grigory w= thund@\ruck. $e boy looked sarc=tically at h` teach@.
$@e w= someth{g pos~ively c}descend{g { h` expressi}. Grigory
could not re\ra{ himself. “I’ll show you wh@e!” he cried, & gave #
boy a violent slap } # cheek. $e boy %ok # slap w~hout a word, but
w~hdrew {% h` corn@ aga{ for some days. A week lat@ he had h`
fir\ attack of # d`e=e % which he w= subject all # re\ of h`
life—epilepsy. When Fyodor Pavlov~ch heard of ~, h` att~ude % # boy
seemed changed at }ce. Till #n he had taken no notice of him, though he
nev@ scolded him, & always gave him a copeck when he met him.
Sometimes, when he w= { good humor, he would send # boy someth{g
sweet from h` table. But = so} = he heard of h` illness, he showed an
active {t@e\ { him, sent for a doc%r, & tried remedies, but #
d`e=e turned out % be {curable. $e f~s occurred, } an av@age, }ce
a m}th, but at various {t@vals. $e f~s varied %o, { violence: some
w@e light & some w@e v@y sev@e. Fyodor Pavlov~ch \rictly forbade
Grigory % use corporal pun`hment % # boy, & began allow{g him %
come up\airs % him. He forbade him % be taught anyth{g whatev@ for a
time, %o. One day when # boy w= about fifteen, Fyodor Pavlov~ch
noticed him l{g@{g by # bookc=e, & read{g # t~les through #
gl=s. Fyodor Pavlov~ch had a fair numb@ of books—ov@ a hundred—but no
}e ev@ saw him read{g. He at }ce gave Sm@dyakov # key of #
bookc=e. “Come, read. You shall be my librarian. You’ll be bett@ s~t{g
read{g than hang{g about # courtyard. Come, read th`,” & Fyodor
Pavlov~ch gave him _Even{gs { a Cottage near Dikanka_.

He read a l~tle but didn’t like ~. He did not }ce smile, & ended by
frown{g.

“Why? Isn’t ~ funny?” =ked Fyodor Pavlov~ch.

Sm@dyakov did not speak.

“Answ@, \upid!”

“It’s all untrue,” mumbled # boy, w~h a gr{.

“$en go % # devil! You have # soul of a lackey. Stay, h@e’s
Smaragdov’s _Univ@sal H`%ry_. $at’s all true. Read that.”

But Sm@dyakov did not get through ten pages of Smaragdov. He thought ~
dull. So # bookc=e w= closed aga{.

Shortly aft@wards Marfa & Grigory reported % Fyodor Pavlov~ch that
Sm@dyakov w= gradually beg{n{g % show an extraord{ary
f=tidiousness. He would s~ before h` soup, take up h` spo} & look
{% # soup, bend ov@ ~, exam{e ~, take a spo}ful & hold ~ %
# light.

“What ` ~? A beetle?” Grigory would =k.

“A fly, p@haps,” obs@ved Marfa.

$e squeam`h youth nev@ answ@ed, but he did # same w~h h` bread,
h` meat, & ev@yth{g he ate. He would hold a piece } h` fork % #
light, scrut{ize ~ microscopically, & }ly aft@ l}g delib@ati}

“Ach! What f{e gentlemen’s airs!” Grigory mutt@ed, look{g at him.

When Fyodor Pavlov~ch heard of th` development { Sm@dyakov he
det@m{ed % make him h` cook, & sent him % Moscow % be tra{ed. He
spent some years #re & came back remarkably changed { appearance. He
looked extraord{arily old for h` age. H` face had grown wr{kled,

Fyodor Pavlov~ch began % regard him ra#r diff@ently. H` f~s w@e

“Why are your f~s gett{g worse?” =ked Fyodor Pavlov~ch, look{g
=kance at h` new cook. “Would you like % get married? Shall I f{d you
a wife?”

But Sm@dyakov turned pale w~h ang@, & made no reply. Fyodor
Pavlov~ch left him w~h an impatient ge\ure. $e great th{g w= that he
had absolute c}fidence { h` h}e\y. It happened }ce, when Fyodor
Pavlov~ch w= drunk, that he dropped { # muddy courtyard three

“Well, my lad, I’ve nev@ met any }e like you,” Fyodor Pavlov~ch said
shortly, & gave him ten roubles. We may add that he not }ly believed {
h` h}e\y, but had, for some re=}, a lik{g for him, although #

He rarely spoke. If ~ had occurred % any }e % w}d@ at # time what

w~h{ himself, # impressi} which had dom{ated him dur{g # p@iod
of c}templati}. $ose impressi}s are dear % him & no doubt he hoards
#m imp@ceptibly, & even unc}sciously. How & why, of course, he
does not know ei#r. He may suddenly, aft@ hoard{g impressi}s for many
years, ab&} ev@yth{g & go off % J@usalem } a pilgrimage for h`

$$ VII. $e C}trov@sy


But Balaam’s =s had suddenly spoken. $e subject w= a \range }e.
Grigory had g}e { # morn{g % make purch=es, & had heard from #
shopkeep@ Lukyanov # s%ry of a Russian soldi@ which had appeared {
# newspap@ of that day. $` soldi@ had been taken pr`}@ { some
remote part of Asia, & w= threatened w~h an immediate ag}iz{g death
if he did not renounce Chri\ian~y & follow Islam. He refused % deny
h` fa~h, & w= %rtured, flayed alive, & died, pra`{g &
glorify{g Chri\. Grigory had related # s%ry at table. Fyodor
Pavlov~ch always liked, ov@ # dess@t aft@ d{n@, % laugh & talk,
if }ly w~h Grigory. $` aft@no} he w= { a particularly good-humored
& expansive mood. Sipp{g h` br&y & li\en{g % # s%ry, he
obs@ved that #y ought % make a sa{t of a soldi@ like that, & %
take h` sk{ % some m}=t@y. “$at would make # people flock, &
br{g # m}ey {.”

Grigory frowned, see{g that Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= by no means %uched,
but, = usual, w= beg{n{g % scoff. At that moment Sm@dyakov, who w=
\&{g by # door, smiled. Sm@dyakov often wa~ed at table %wards #
end of d{n@, & s{ce Ivan’s arrival { our %wn he had d}e so ev@y
day.

“What are you gr{n{g at?” =ked Fyodor Pavlov~ch, catch{g # smile
{\antly, & know{g that ~ ref@red % Grigory.

“Well, my op{i} `,” Sm@dyakov began suddenly & unexpectedly { a
loud voice, “that if that laudable soldi@’s explo~ w= so v@y great
#re would have been, % my th{k{g, no s{ { ~ if he had } such an
em@gency renounced, so % speak, # name of Chri\ & h` own

“How could ~ not be a s{? You’re talk{g n}sense. For that you’ll go
\raight % hell & be ro=ted #re like mut%n,” put { Fyodor
Pavlov~ch.

It w= at th` po{t that Alyosha came {, & Fyodor Pavlov~ch, = we
have seen, w= highly delighted at h` appearance.

“We’re } your subject, your subject,” he chuckled gleefully, mak{g
Alyosha s~ down % li\en.

“As for mut%n, that’s not so, & #re’ll be noth{g #re for th`, &
#re shouldn’t be ei#r, if ~’s accord{g % ju\ice,” Sm@dyakov
ma{ta{ed s%utly.

“How do you mean ‘accord{g % ju\ice’?” Fyodor Pavlov~ch cried \ill
more gayly, nudg{g Alyosha w~h h` knee.

“He’s a r=cal, that’s what he `!” bur\ from Grigory. He looked
Sm@dyakov wrathfully { # face.

“As for be{g a r=cal, wa~ a l~tle, Grigory V=silyev~ch,” answ@ed
Sm@dyakov w~h p@fect composure. “You’d bett@ c}sid@ yourself that,
}ce I am taken pr`}@ by # enemies of # Chri\ian race, & #y
dem& from me % curse # name of God & % renounce my holy

would be no s{ { ~.”

“But you’ve said that before. D}’t w=te words. Prove ~,” cried Fyodor
Pavlov~ch.

“Soup-mak@!” mutt@ed Grigory c}temptuously.

“As for be{g a soup-mak@, wa~ a b~, %o, & c}sid@ for yourself,
Grigory V=silyev~ch, w~hout abus{g me. For = so} = I say % those
enemies, ‘No, I’m not a Chri\ian, & I curse my true God,’ #n at }ce,
by God’s high judgment, I become immediately & specially ana#ma

when I th{k of say{g ~, before a quart@ of a sec}d h= p=sed, I am
cut off. Is that so or not, Grigory V=silyev~ch?”

He addressed Grigory w~h obvious sat`facti}, though he w= really
answ@{g Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s que\i}s, & w= well aware of ~, &
{tenti}ally pretend{g that Grigory had =ked # que\i}s.

“Ivan,” cried Fyodor Pavlov~ch suddenly, “s%op down for me % wh`p@.
He’s got th` all up for your benef~. He wants you % pra`e him. Pra`e
him.”

Ivan li\ened w~h p@fect s@iousness % h` fa#r’s exc~ed wh`p@.

“Stay, Sm@dyakov, be quiet a m{ute,” cried Fyodor Pavlov~ch }ce more.
“Ivan, your ear aga{.”

Ivan bent down aga{ w~h a p@fectly grave face.

“I love you = I do Alyosha. D}’t th{k I d}’t love you. Some br&y?”

“Yes.—But you’re ra#r drunk yourself,” thought Ivan, look{g \eadily at
h` fa#r.

He w= watch{g Sm@dyakov w~h great curios~y.

“You’re ana#ma accursed, = ~ `,” Grigory suddenly bur\ out, “& how
dare you argue, you r=cal, aft@ that, if—”

“D}’t scold him, Grigory, d}’t scold him,” Fyodor Pavlov~ch cut him
short.

“You should wa~, Grigory V=silyev~ch, if }ly a short time, & li\en,
for I haven’t f{`hed all I had % say. For at # v@y moment I become
accursed, at that same highe\ moment, I become exactly like a hea#n,
& my chri\en{g ` taken off me & becomes of no avail. Isn’t that
so?”

“Make h=te & f{`h, my boy,” Fyodor Pavlov~ch urged him, sipp{g from
h` w{e-gl=s w~h rel`h.

“And if I’ve ce=ed % be a Chri\ian, #n I %ld no lie % # enemy
when #y =ked whe#r I w= a Chri\ian or not a Chri\ian, see{g I had

I can’t renounce Chri\, for I’ve noth{g #n % renounce. Who will hold
an unclean Tatar resp}sible, Grigory V=silyev~ch, even { heaven, for
not hav{g been born a Chri\ian? And who would pun`h him for that,
c}sid@{g that you can’t take two sk{s off }e ox? For God Almighty
Himself, even if He did make # Tatar resp}sible, when he dies would

Grigory w= thund@\ruck & looked at # ora%r, h` eyes nearly
\art{g out of h` head. $ough he did not clearly und@\& what w=
said, he had caught someth{g { th` rigmarole, & s%od, look{g like a
man who h= ju\ h~ h` head aga{\ a wall. Fyodor Pavlov~ch emptied
h` gl=s & went off {% h` shrill laugh.

“Alyosha! Alyosha! What do you say % that! Ah, you c=ui\! He mu\ have
been w~h # Jesu~s, somewh@e, Ivan. Oh, you \{k{g Jesu~, who

“$@e ` no doubt that I have renounced ~ { my own heart, but #re w=

“How’s that # mo\ ord{ary?”

“You lie, accursed }e!” h`sed Grigory.

“C}sid@ yourself, Grigory V=silyev~ch,” Sm@dyakov went }, \aid &

“Stay!” cried Fyodor Pavlov~ch, { a transport of delight. “So you do
suppose #re are two who can move mounta{s? Ivan, make a note of ~,
wr~e ~ down. $@e you have # Russian all ov@!”

“You’re qu~e right { say{g ~’s charact@i\ic of # people’s fa~h,”
Ivan =sented, w~h an approv{g smile.

“You agree. $en ~ mu\ be so, if you agree. It’s true, `n’t ~,
Alyosha? $at’s # Russian fa~h all ov@, `n’t ~?”

“No, Sm@dyakov h= not # Russian fa~h at all,” said Alyosha firmly &
gravely.

“I’m not talk{g about h` fa~h. I mean those two { # des@t, }ly
that idea. Surely that’s Russian, `n’t ~?”

“Yes, that’s purely Russian,” said Alyosha smil{g.

“Your words are worth a gold piece, O =s, & I’ll give ~ % you %-day.
But = % # re\ you talk n}sense, n}sense, n}sense. Let me tell you,
\upid, that we h@e are all of l~tle fa~h, }ly from carelessness,
because we haven’t time; th{gs are %o much for us, &, { # sec}d

when you’d noth{g else % th{k about but % show your fa~h! So I
c}sid@, bro#r, that ~ c}\~utes a s{.”

“C}\~ute a s{ ~ may, but c}sid@ yourself, Grigory V=silyev~ch,
that ~ }ly extenuates ~, if ~ does c}\~ute. If I had believed #n
{ v@y truth, = I ought % have believed, #n ~ really would have been

But, suppose at that v@y moment I had tried all that, & cried % that
mounta{, ‘Crush #se %rmen%rs,’ & ~ hadn’t crushed #m, how could
I have helped doubt{g, pray, at such a time, & at such a dread hour of
mortal t@ror? And apart from that, I should know already that I could not
atta{ % # fullness of # K{gdom of Heaven (for s{ce # mounta{
had not moved at my word, #y could not th{k v@y much of my fa~h up

even #n # mounta{ would not have moved at my word or at my cry. And
at such a moment not }ly doubt might come ov@ }e but }e might lose
}e’s re=} from fear, so that }e would not be able % th{k at all.
And, #refore, how should I be particularly % blame if not see{g my

w= already a gl=s %o much.

“Get al}g w~h you, Jesu~s!” he cried % # s@vants. “Go away,

“Sm@dyakov always pokes himself { now, aft@ d{n@. It’s you he’s so

“Noth{g whatev@,” answ@ed Ivan. “He’s ple=ed % have a high op{i} of

“For revoluti}?”

“$@e will be o#rs & bett@ }es. But #re will be some like him =

“And when will # time come?”

“$e rocket will go off & fizzle out, p@haps. $e pe=ants are not v@y

“Ah, bro#r, but a Balaam’s =s like that th{ks & th{ks, & #

“He’s s%r{g up ide=,” said Ivan, smil{g.

“You see, I know he can’t bear me, nor any }e else, even you, though you
fancy that he h= a high op{i} of you. Worse \ill w~h Alyosha, he

“Of course he `n’t.”

“And = for # ide= he may be hatch{g, # Russian pe=ant, gen@ally

“You’ve had ano#r gl=s. $at’s enough.”

“Wa~ a b~. I’ll have }e more, & #n ano#r, & #n I’ll s%p. No,

“No, I d}’t believe ~.”

“And I believe you d}’t, & that you speak # truth. You look s{c@e

“But why suppress ~?” =ked Ivan.

“$at Truth may prevail. $at’s why.”

“Well, if Truth w@e % prevail, you know, you’d be # fir\ % be robbed

“Ah! I dare say you’re right. Ah, I’m an =s!” bur\ out Fyodor

“Wouldn’t #re have been? W~hout God?”

“No. And #re would have been no br&y ei#r. But I mu\ take your

“S%p, s%p, s%p, dear boy, }e more l~tle gl=s. I’ve hurt Alyosha’s

“You mu\ love him” (Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= by th` time v@y drunk).
“Li\en, Alyosha, I w= rude % your eld@ th` morn{g. But I w=
exc~ed. But #re’s w~ { that eld@, d}’t you th{k, Ivan?”

“V@y likely.”

“$@e `, #re `. _Il y a du Pir} là-dedans._ He’s a Jesu~, a Russian

boil{g w~h{ him at hav{g % pretend & affect hol{ess.”

“But, of course, he believes { God.”

“Not a b~ of ~. Didn’t you know? Why, he tells ev@y }e so, himself.
$at `, not ev@y }e, but all # clev@ people who come % him. He said
\raight out % Gov@nor Schultz not l}g ago: ‘_Credo_, but I d}’t know
{ what.’ ”

“Really?”

“He really did. But I respect him. $@e’s someth{g of Meph`%pheles
about him, or ra#r of ‘$e h@o of our time’ ... Arben{, or what’s h`

be afraid for my daught@ or my wife if she went % c}fess % him. You
know, when he beg{s tell{g s%ries.... $e year before l=t he {v~ed
us % tea, tea w~h liqueur (# ladies send him liqueur), & began
tell{g us about old times till we nearly spl~ our sides.... Especially
how he }ce cured a paralyzed woman. ‘If my legs w@e not bad I know a
dance I could dance you,’ he said. What do you say % that? ‘I’ve plenty
of tricks { my time,’ said he. He did D@nidov, # m@chant, out of

“What, he s%le ~?”

“He brought him # m}ey = a man he could tru\, say{g, ‘Take care of
~ for me, friend, #re’ll be a police search at my place %-morrow.’ And
he kept ~. ‘You have given ~ % # Church,’ he declared. I said % him:
‘You’re a scoundrel,’ I said. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I’m not a scoundrel, but I’m
broad-m{ded.’ But that w=n’t he, that w= some }e else. I’ve muddled
him w~h some }e else ... w~hout notic{g ~. Come, ano#r gl=s &
that’s enough. Take away # bottle, Ivan. I’ve been tell{g lies. Why
didn’t you s%p me, Ivan, & tell me I w= ly{g?”

“I knew you’d s%p of yourself.”

“$at’s a lie. You did ~ from sp~e, from simple sp~e aga{\ me. You
desp`e me. You have come % me & desp`ed me { my own house.”

“Well, I’m go{g away. You’ve had %o much br&y.”

“I’ve begged you for Chri\’s sake % go % Tch@m=hnya for a day or two,
& you d}’t go.”

“I’ll go %-morrow if you’re so set up} ~.”

“You w}’t go. You want % keep an eye } me. $at’s what you want,
sp~eful fellow. $at’s why you w}’t go.”

$e old man p@si\ed. He had reached that \ate of drunkenness when #
drunkard who h= till #n been {offensive tries % pick a quarrel & %
=s@t himself.

“Why are you look{g at me? Why do you look like that? Your eyes look at
me & say, ‘You ugly drunkard!’ Your eyes are mi\ru\ful. $ey’re
c}temptuous.... You’ve come h@e w~h some design. Alyosha, h@e, looks
at me & h` eyes sh{e. Alyosha doesn’t desp`e me. Alexey, you mu\n’t

“D}’t be ill-temp@ed w~h my bro#r. Leave off attack{g him,” Alyosha
said emphatically.

“Oh, all right. Ugh, my head aches. Take away # br&y, Ivan. It’s #
third time I’ve %ld you.”

He mused, & suddenly a slow, cunn{g gr{ spread ov@ h` face.

“D}’t be angry w~h a feeble old man, Ivan. I know you d}’t love me, but
d}’t be angry all # same. You’ve noth{g % love me for. You go %

And he k`sed h` h& w~h a smack.

“To my th{k{g,” he revived at }ce, seem{g % grow sob@ # {\ant he

$e old man jumped up { alarm. From # time he had begun speak{g about

% Ivan.

“But she w= my mo#r, %o, I believe, h` mo#r. W= she not?” said

$$ IX. $e Sensuali\s


Grigory & Sm@dyakov ran {% # room aft@ Dm~ri. $ey had been

Dm~ri utt@ed a scream ra#r than a shout & rushed at Grigory.

“$en she’s #re! She’s hidden #re! Out of # way, scoundrel!”

He tried % pull Grigory away, but # old s@vant pushed him back. Beside
himself w~h fury, Dm~ri \ruck out, & h~ Grigory w~h all h` might.
$e old man fell like a log, & Dm~ri, leap{g ov@ him, broke { #

“She’s h@e!” shouted Dm~ri. “I saw h@ turn %wards # house ju\ now,

$at shout, “She’s h@e!” produced an {describable effect } Fyodor
Pavlov~ch. All h` t@ror left him.

“Hold him! Hold him!” he cried, & d=hed aft@ Dm~ri. Meanwhile Grigory
had got up from # floor, but \ill seemed \unned. Ivan & Alyosha ran
aft@ #ir fa#r. In # third room someth{g w= heard % fall } #

“At him!” shouted # old man. “Help!”

Ivan & Alyosha caught # old man & w@e forcibly br{g{g him back.

“Why do you run aft@ him? He’ll murd@ you outright,” Ivan cried
wrathfully at h` fa#r.

“Ivan! Alyosha! She mu\ be h@e. Grushenka’s h@e. He said he saw h@

He w= chok{g. He w= not expect{g Grushenka at # time, & # sudden

He seemed frantic.

“But you’ve seen for yourself that she h=n’t come,” cried Ivan.

“But she may have come by that o#r entrance.”

“You know that entrance ` locked, & you have # key.”

Dm~ri suddenly reappeared { # draw{g-room. He had, of course, found
# o#r entrance locked, & # key actually w= { Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s
pocket. $e w{dows of all # rooms w@e also closed, so Grushenka could
not have come { anywh@e nor have run out anywh@e.

“Hold him!” shrieked Fyodor Pavlov~ch, = so} = he saw him aga{. “He’s
been \eal{g m}ey { my bedroom.” And tear{g himself from Ivan he
rushed aga{ at Dm~ri. But Dm~ri threw up both h&s & suddenly
clutched # old man by # two tufts of hair that rema{ed } h`
temples, tugged at #m, & flung him w~h a cr=h } # floor. He
kicked him two or three times w~h h` heel { # face. $e old man
moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so \r}g = Dm~ri, threw h` arms round
him, & w~h all h` might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him w~h h`
slend@ \rength, hold{g Dm~ri { fr}t.

“Madman! You’ve killed him!” cried Ivan.

“S@ve him right!” shouted Dm~ri breathlessly. “If I haven’t killed him,
I’ll come aga{ & kill him. You can’t protect him!”

“Dm~ri! Go away at }ce!” cried Alyosha comm&{gly.

“Alexey! You tell me. It’s }ly you I can believe; w= she h@e ju\ now,
or not? I saw h@ myself creep{g th` way by # fence from # lane. I

“I swear she’s not been h@e, & no }e expected h@.”

“But I saw h@.... So she mu\ ... I’ll f{d out at }ce wh@e she `....
Good-by, Alexey! Not a word % Æsop about # m}ey now. But go %
Kat@{a Ivanovna at }ce & be sure % say, ‘He sends h` compliments %

Describe # scene % h@.”

Meanwhile Ivan & Grigory had ra`ed # old man & seated him { an
arm-chair. H` face w= cov@ed w~h blood, but he w= c}scious &
li\ened greedily % Dm~ri’s cries. He w= \ill fancy{g that Grushenka
really w= somewh@e { # house. Dm~ri looked at him w~h hatred = he
went out.

“I d}’t repent shedd{g your blood!” he cried. “Beware, old man, beware
of your dream, for I have my dream, %o. I curse you, & d`own you
al%ge#r.”

He ran out of # room.

“She’s h@e. She mu\ be h@e. Sm@dyakov! Sm@dyakov!” # old man
wheezed, scarcely audibly, beck}{g % him w~h h` f{g@.

“No, she’s not h@e, you old lunatic!” Ivan shouted at him angrily. “H@e,
he’s fa{t{g! Wat@! A %wel! Make h=te, Sm@dyakov!”

Sm@dyakov ran for wat@. At l=t #y got # old man undressed, & put
him % bed. $ey wrapped a wet %wel round h` head. Exhau\ed by #
br&y, by h` violent emoti}, & # blows he had received, he shut h`

Alyosha went back % # draw{g-room. Sm@dyakov removed # fragments of

“Shouldn’t you put a wet b&age } your head & go % bed, %o?” Alyosha
said % him. “We’ll look aft@ him. My bro#r gave you a t@rible blow—}
# head.”

“He’s {sulted me!” Grigory articulated gloomily & di\{ctly.

“He’s ‘{sulted’ h` fa#r, not }ly you,” obs@ved Ivan w~h a forced
smile.

“I used % w=h him { h` tub. He’s {sulted me,” repeated Grigory.

“Damn ~ all, if I hadn’t pulled him away p@haps he’d have murd@ed him.
It wouldn’t take much % do for Æsop, would ~?” wh`p@ed Ivan %
Alyosha.

“God forbid!” cried Alyosha.

“Why should He forbid?” Ivan went } { # same wh`p@, w~h a malignant
grimace. “One reptile will devour # o#r. And s@ve #m both right,
%o.”

Alyosha shudd@ed.

“Of course I w}’t let him be murd@ed = I didn’t ju\ now. Stay h@e,
Alyosha, I’ll go for a turn { # yard. My head’s begun % ache.”

Alyosha went % h` fa#r’s bedroom & sat by h` bedside beh{d #
screen for about an hour. $e old man suddenly opened h` eyes & gazed
for a l}g while at Alyosha, evidently rememb@{g & med~at{g. All at
}ce h` face betrayed extraord{ary exc~ement.

“Alyosha,” he wh`p@ed apprehensively, “wh@e’s Ivan?”

“In # yard. He’s got a headache. He’s } # watch.”

“Give me that look{g-gl=s. It \&s ov@ #re. Give ~ me.”

Alyosha gave him a l~tle round fold{g look{g-gl=s which s%od } #

c}sid@ably swollen, & } # left side of h` forehead #re w= a

“What does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my }ly s}, I’m afraid of Ivan.
I’m more afraid of Ivan than # o#r. You’re # }ly }e I’m not afraid

“D}’t be afraid of Ivan ei#r. He ` angry, but he’ll defend you.”

“Alyosha, & what of # o#r? He’s run % Grushenka. My angel, tell me
# truth, w= she h@e ju\ now or not?”

“No }e h= seen h@. It w= a mi\ake. She h= not been h@e.”

“You know M~ya wants % marry h@, % marry h@.”

“She w}’t marry him.”

“She w}’t. She w}’t. She w}’t. She w}’t } any account!”

$e old man fairly flutt@ed w~h joy, = though noth{g more comfort{g
could have been said % him. In h` delight he seized Alyosha’s h& &
pressed ~ warmly % h` heart. Tears pos~ively gl~t@ed { h` eyes.

“$at image of # Mo#r of God of which I w= tell{g you ju\ now,” he
said. “Take ~ home & keep ~ for yourself. And I’ll let you go back %

“You’re \ill =k{g whe#r she h= been h@e or not?” Alyosha said
sorrowfully.

“No, no, no. I believe you. I’ll tell you what ~ `: you go % Grushenka

“If I see h@ I’ll =k h@,” Alyosha mutt@ed, embarr=sed.

“No, she w}’t tell you,” # old man {t@rupted, “she’s a rogue. She’ll

“No, fa#r, & ~ wouldn’t be su~able, ~ wouldn’t be right at all.”

“Wh@e w= he send{g you ju\ now? He shouted ‘Go’ = he ran away.”

“To Kat@{a Ivanovna.”

“For m}ey? To =k h@ for m}ey?”

“No. Not for m}ey.”

“He’s no m}ey; not a farth{g. I’ll settle down for # night, & th{k

“Yes.”

“When you come, pretend you’ve come of your own accord % =k aft@ me.
D}’t tell any }e I %ld you %. D}’t say a word % Ivan.”

“V@y well.”

“Good-by, my angel. You s%od up for me, ju\ now. I shall nev@ forget

“And how do you feel now?”

“But you’re go{g % h@ now, anyway? For that ‘compliments &

“Bro#r, how will all th` horror end between fa#r & Dm~ri?”

“One can’t tell for c@ta{. P@haps { noth{g: ~ may all fizzle out.

“What are you say{g, Ivan? Such an idea nev@ crossed my m{d. I d}’t

of all h@ do{gs.

When Alyosha ent@ed # hall & =ked # maid who opened # door %
him % take h` name up, ~ w= evident that #y w@e already aware of
h` arrival. Possibly he had been noticed from # w{dow. At le=t,
Alyosha heard a no`e, caught # sound of fly{g foot\eps & ru\l{g
skirts. Two or three women, p@haps, had run out of # room.

Alyosha thought ~ \range that h` arrival should cause such exc~ement.
He w= c}ducted howev@ % # draw{g-room at }ce. It w= a large room,
elegantly & amply furn`hed, not at all { prov{cial \yle. $@e w@e
many sof=, lounges, settees, big & l~tle tables. $@e w@e pictures
} # walls, v=es & lamps } # tables, m=ses of flow@s, & even
an aquarium { # w{dow. It w= twilight & ra#r dark. Alyosha made
out a silk mantle thrown down } # sofa, wh@e people had evidently ju\
been s~t{g; & } a table { fr}t of # sofa w@e two unf{`hed cups
of chocolate, cakes, a gl=s sauc@ w~h blue ra`{s, & ano#r w~h
sweetmeats. Alyosha saw that he had {t@rupted v`i%rs, & frowned. But
at that {\ant # portière w= ra`ed, & w~h rapid, hurry{g
foot\eps Kat@{a Ivanovna came {, hold{g out both h&s % Alyosha
w~h a radiant smile of delight. At # same {\ant a s@vant brought {
two lighted c&les & set #m } # table.

“$ank God! At l=t you have come %o! I’ve been simply pray{g for you
all day! S~ down.”

Alyosha had been \ruck by Kat@{a Ivanovna’s beauty when, three weeks
before, Dm~ri had fir\ brought him, at Kat@{a Ivanovna’s special
reque\, % be {troduced % h@. $@e had been no c}v@sati} between
#m at that {t@view, howev@. Suppos{g Alyosha % be v@y shy,
Kat@{a Ivanovna had talked all # time % Dm~ri % spare him. Alyosha
had been silent, but he had seen a great deal v@y clearly. He w= \ruck
by # imp@iousness, proud e=e, & self-c}fidence of # haughty girl.
And all that w= c@ta{, Alyosha felt that he w= not exagg@at{g ~. He
thought h@ great glow{g black eyes w@e v@y f{e, especially w~h h@
pale, even ra#r sallow, l}g`h face. But { those eyes & { # l{es
of h@ exqu`~e lips #re w= someth{g w~h which h` bro#r might
well be p=si}ately { love, but which p@haps could not be loved for
l}g. He expressed th` thought almo\ pla{ly % Dm~ri when, aft@ #
v`~, h` bro#r besought & {si\ed that he should not c}ceal h`
impressi}s } see{g h` betro#d.

“You’ll be happy w~h h@, but p@haps—not tranquilly happy.”

“Qu~e so, bro#r. Such people rema{ always # same. $ey d}’t yield
% fate. So you th{k I shan’t love h@ for ev@.”

“No; p@haps you will love h@ for ev@. But p@haps you w}’t always be
happy w~h h@.”

Alyosha had given h` op{i} at # time, blush{g, & angry w~h
himself for hav{g yielded % h` bro#r’s entreaties & put such
“fool`h” ide= {% words. For h` op{i} had \ruck him = awfully
fool`h immediately aft@ he had utt@ed ~. He felt =hamed %o of hav{g
given so c}fident an op{i} about a woman. It w= w~h # more
amazement that he felt now, at # fir\ glance at Kat@{a Ivanovna =
she ran { % him, that he had p@haps been utt@ly mi\aken. $` time
h@ face w= beam{g w~h sp}taneous good-natured k{dl{ess, & direct
warm-hearted s{c@~y. $e “pride & haught{ess,” which had \ruck
Alyosha so much before, w= }ly betrayed now { a frank, gen@ous en@gy
& a sort of bright, \r}g fa~h { h@self. Alyosha realized at #
fir\ glance, at # fir\ word, that all # tragedy of h@ pos~i} {
relati} % # man she loved so dearly w= no secret % h@; that she
p@haps already knew ev@yth{g, pos~ively ev@yth{g. And yet, { sp~e
of that, #re w= such brightness { h@ face, such fa~h { # future.
Alyosha felt at }ce that he had gravely wr}ged h@ { h` thoughts. He
w= c}qu@ed & captivated immediately. Besides all th`, he noticed at
h@ fir\ words that she w= { great exc~ement, an exc~ement p@haps
qu~e excepti}al & almo\ approach{g ec\=y.

“I w= so eag@ % see you, because I can learn from you # whole
truth—from you & no }e else.”

“I have come,” mutt@ed Alyosha c}fusedly, “I—he sent me.”

“Ah, he sent you! I foresaw that. Now I know ev@yth{g—ev@yth{g!” cried
Kat@{a Ivanovna, h@ eyes fl=h{g. “Wa~ a moment, Alexey Fyodorov~ch,
I’ll tell you why I’ve been so l}g{g % see you. You see, I know p@haps
far more than you do yourself, & #re’s no need for you % tell me
anyth{g. I’ll tell you what I want from you. I want % know your own l=t
impressi} of him. I want you % tell me mo\ directly, pla{ly, coarsely
even (oh, = coarsely = you like!), what you thought of him ju\ now &
of h` pos~i} aft@ your meet{g w~h him %-day. $at will p@haps be
bett@ than if I had a p@s}al explanati} w~h him, = he does not want
% come % me. Do you und@\& what I want from you? Now, tell me
simply, tell me ev@y word of # message he sent you w~h (I knew he
would send you).”

“He %ld me % give you h` compliments—& % say that he would nev@
come aga{—but % give you h` compliments.”

“H` compliments? W= that what he said—h` own expressi}?”

“Yes.”

“Accidentally p@haps he made a mi\ake { # word, p@haps he did not
use # right word?”

“No; he %ld me prec`ely % repeat that word. He begged me two or three
times not % forget % say so.”

Kat@{a Ivanovna flushed hotly.

“Help me now, Alexey Fyodorov~ch. Now I really need your help. I’ll tell
you what I th{k, & you mu\ simply say whe#r ~’s right or not.
Li\en! If he had sent me h` compliments { p=s{g, w~hout {si\{g }
your repeat{g # words, w~hout emph=iz{g #m, that would be # end
of ev@yth{g! But if he particularly {si\ed } those words, if he
particularly %ld you not % forget % repeat #m % me, #n p@haps he
w= { exc~ement, beside himself. He had made h` dec`i} & w=
frightened at ~. He w=n’t walk{g away from me w~h a resolute \ep, but
leap{g headl}g. $e emph=` } that phr=e may have been simply
bravado.”

“Yes, yes!” cried Alyosha warmly. “I believe that ` ~.”

“And, if so, he’s not al%ge#r lo\. I can \ill save him. Stay! Did he
not tell you anyth{g about m}ey—about three thous& roubles?”

“He did speak about ~, & ~’s that more than anyth{g that’s crush{g
him. He said he had lo\ h` h}or & that noth{g matt@s now,” Alyosha
answ@ed warmly, feel{g a rush of hope { h` heart & believ{g that
#re really might be a way of escape & salvati} for h` bro#r. “But
do you know about # m}ey?” he added, & suddenly broke off.

“I’ve known of ~ a l}g time; I telegraphed % Moscow % {quire, &
heard l}g ago that # m}ey had not arrived. He hadn’t sent # m}ey,
but I said noth{g. L=t week I learnt that he w= \ill { need of m}ey.
My }ly object { all th` w= that he should know % whom % turn, &
who w= h` true friend. No, he w}’t recognize that I am h` true\
friend; he w}’t know me, & looks } me m@ely = a woman. I’ve been
%rmented all # week, try{g % th{k how % prevent him from be{g
=hamed % face me because he spent that three thous&. Let him feel
=hamed of himself, let him be =hamed of o#r people’s know{g, but not
of my know{g. He can tell God ev@yth{g w~hout shame. Why ` ~ he
\ill does not und@\& how much I am ready % bear for h` sake? Why,
why doesn’t he know me? How dare he not know me aft@ all that h=
happened? I want % save him for ev@. Let him forget me = h` betro#d.
And h@e he fears that he ` d`h}ored { my eyes. Why, he w=n’t afraid
% be open w~h you, Alexey Fyodorov~ch. How ` ~ that I d}’t des@ve
# same?”

$e l=t words she utt@ed { tears. Tears gushed from h@ eyes.

“I mu\ tell you,” Alyosha began, h` voice trembl{g %o, “what happened
ju\ now between him & my fa#r.”

And he described # whole scene, how Dm~ri had sent him % get #
m}ey, how he had broken {, knocked h` fa#r down, & aft@ that had
aga{ specially & emphatically begged him % take h` compliments &
farewell. “He went % that woman,” Alyosha added softly.

“And do you suppose that I can’t put up w~h that woman? Does he th{k I
can’t? But he w}’t marry h@,” she suddenly laughed n@vously. “Could
such a p=si} l=t for ev@ { a Karamazov? It’s p=si}, not love. He
w}’t marry h@ because she w}’t marry him.” Aga{ Kat@{a Ivanovna
laughed \rangely.

“He may marry h@,” said Alyosha mournfully, look{g down.

“He w}’t marry h@, I tell you. $at girl ` an angel. Do you know that?
Do you know that?” Kat@{a Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly w~h extraord{ary
warmth. “She ` }e of # mo\ fant=tic of fant=tic creatures. I know
how bew~ch{g she `, but I know %o that she ` k{d, firm & noble.
Why do you look at me like that, Alexey Fyodorov~ch? P@haps you are
w}d@{g at my words, p@haps you d}’t believe me? Agrafena
Alex&rovna, my angel!” she cried suddenly % some }e, peep{g {% #
next room, “come { % us. $` ` a friend. $` ` Alyosha. He knows all
about our affairs. Show yourself % him.”

“I’ve }ly been wa~{g beh{d # curta{ for you % call me,” said a
soft, }e might even say sugary, fem{{e voice.

$e portière w= ra`ed & Grushenka h@self, smil{g & beam{g, came
up % # table. A violent revulsi} p=sed ov@ Alyosha. He fixed h`
eyes } h@ & could not take #m off. H@e she w=, that awful woman,
# “be=t,” = Ivan had called h@ half an hour before. And yet }e would
have thought # creature \&{g before him mo\ simple & ord{ary, a
good-natured, k{d woman, h&some c@ta{ly, but so like o#r h&some
ord{ary women! It ` true she w= v@y, v@y good-look{g w~h that
Russian beauty so p=si}ately loved by many men. She w= a ra#r tall
woman, though a l~tle short@ than Kat@{a Ivanovna, who w=
excepti}ally tall. She had a full figure, w~h soft, = ~ w@e,
no`eless, movements, softened % a peculiar ov@-sweetness, like h@
voice. She moved, not like Kat@{a Ivanovna, w~h a vigorous, bold \ep,
but no`elessly. H@ feet made absolutely no sound } # floor. She sank
softly {% a low chair, softly ru\l{g h@ sumptuous black silk dress,
& delicately ne\l{g h@ milk-wh~e neck & broad should@s { a
co\ly c=hm@e shawl. She w= twenty-two years old, & h@ face looked
exactly that age. She w= v@y wh~e { # face, w~h a pale p{k t{t }
h@ cheeks. $e model{g of h@ face might be said % be %o broad, &
# low@ jaw w= set a trifle forward. H@ upp@ lip w= th{, but #
slightly prom{ent low@ lip w= at le=t twice = full, & looked
pout{g. But h@ magnificent, abundant dark brown hair, h@ sable-colored
eyebrows & charm{g gray-blue eyes w~h #ir l}g l=hes would have
made # mo\ {diff@ent p@s}, meet{g h@ c=ually { a crowd { #
\reet, s%p at # sight of h@ face & rememb@ ~ l}g aft@. What
\ruck Alyosha mo\ { that face w= ~s expressi} of childlike good
nature. $@e w= a childlike look { h@ eyes, a look of child`h
delight. She came up % # table, beam{g w~h delight & seem{g %
expect someth{g w~h child`h, impatient, & c}fid{g curios~y. $e
light { h@ eyes gladdened # soul—Alyosha felt that. $@e w=
someth{g else { h@ which he could not und@\&, or would not have
been able % def{e, & which yet p@haps unc}sciously affected him. It
w= that softness, that voluptuousness of h@ bodily movements, that
catlike no`elessness. Yet ~ w= a vigorous, ample body. Und@ # shawl
could be seen full broad should@s, a high, \ill qu~e girl`h bosom. H@
figure sugge\ed # l{es of # Venus of Milo, though already {
somewhat exagg@ated proporti}s. $at could be div{ed. C}no`seurs of
Russian beauty could have fore%ld w~h c@ta{ty that th` fresh, \ill
youthful beauty would lose ~s harm}y by # age of thirty, would
“spread”; that # face would become puffy, & that wr{kles would v@y
so} appear up} h@ forehead & round # eyes; # complexi} would
grow coarse & red p@haps—{ fact, that ~ w= # beauty of # moment,
# fleet{g beauty which ` so often met w~h { Russian women. Alyosha,
of course, did not th{k of th`; but though he w= f=c{ated, yet he
w}d@ed w~h an unple=ant sensati}, & = ~ w@e regretfully, why she
drawled { that way & could not speak naturally. She did so evidently
feel{g #re w= a charm { # exagg@ated, h}eyed modulati} of #
syllables. It w=, of course, }ly a bad, und@bred hab~ that showed bad
educati} & a false idea of good mann@s. And yet th` {%nati} &
mann@ of speak{g impressed Alyosha = almo\ {credibly {c}gruous w~h
# child`hly simple & happy expressi} of h@ face, # soft, baby`h
joy { h@ eyes. Kat@{a Ivanovna at }ce made h@ s~ down { an arm-
chair fac{g Alyosha, & ec\atically k`sed h@ sev@al times } h@
smil{g lips. She seemed qu~e { love w~h h@.

“$` ` # fir\ time we’ve met, Alexey Fyodorov~ch,” she said
rapturously. “I wanted % know h@, % see h@. I wanted % go % h@, but
I’d no so}@ expressed # w`h than she came % me. I knew we should
settle ev@yth{g %ge#r—ev@yth{g. My heart %ld me so—I w= begged
not % take # \ep, but I foresaw ~ would be a way out of #
difficulty, & I w= not mi\aken. Grushenka h= expla{ed ev@yth{g %
me, %ld me all she means % do. She flew h@e like an angel of goodness
& brought us peace & joy.”

“You did not d`da{ me, sweet, excellent young lady,” drawled Grushenka
{ h@ s{g-s}g voice, \ill w~h # same charm{g smile of delight.

“D}’t dare % speak % me like that, you sorc@ess, you w~ch! D`da{
you! H@e, I mu\ k`s your low@ lip }ce more. It looks = though ~
w@e swollen, & now ~ will be more so, & more & more. Look how she
laughs, Alexey Fyodorov~ch! It does }e’s heart good % see # angel.”

Alyosha flushed, & fa{t, imp@ceptible shiv@s kept runn{g down him.

“You make so much of me, dear young lady, & p@haps I am not at all
worthy of your k{dness.”

“Not worthy! She’s not worthy of ~!” Kat@{a Ivanovna cried aga{ w~h
# same warmth. “You know, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, we’re fanciful, we’re
self-willed, but proude\ of # proud { our l~tle heart. We’re noble,
we’re gen@ous, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, let me tell you. We have }ly been
unfortunate. We w@e %o ready % make ev@y sacrifice for an unworthy,
p@haps, or fickle man. $@e w= }e man—}e, an offic@ %o, we loved
him, we sacrificed ev@yth{g % him. $at w= l}g ago, five years ago,
& he h= forgotten us, he h= married. Now he ` a widow@, he h=
wr~ten, he ` com{g h@e, &, do you know, we’ve loved him, n}e but
him, all th` time, & we’ve loved him all our life! He will come, &
Grushenka will be happy aga{. For # l=t five years she’s been
wretched. But who can reproach h@, who can bo=t of h@ favor? Only that
bedridden old m@chant, but he ` more like h@ fa#r, h@ friend, h@
protec%r. He found h@ #n { despair, { ag}y, des@ted by # man she
loved. She w= ready % drown h@self #n, but # old m@chant saved
h@—saved h@!”

“You defend me v@y k{dly, dear young lady. You are { a great hurry
about ev@yth{g,” Grushenka drawled aga{.

“Defend you! Is ~ for me % defend you? Should I dare % defend you?
Grushenka, angel, give me your h&. Look at that charm{g soft l~tle
h&, Alexey Fyodorov~ch! Look at ~! It h= brought me happ{ess & h=
lifted me up, & I’m go{g % k`s ~, outside & {side, h@e, h@e,
h@e!”

And three times she k`sed # c@ta{ly charm{g, though ra#r fat, h&
of Grushenka { a sort of rapture. She held out h@ h& w~h a charm{g
musical, n@vous l~tle laugh, watched # “sweet young lady,” &
obviously liked hav{g h@ h& k`sed.

“P@haps #re’s ra#r %o much rapture,” thought Alyosha. He blushed. He
felt a peculiar une={ess at heart # whole time.

“You w}’t make me blush, dear young lady, k`s{g my h& like th`
before Alexey Fyodorov~ch.”

“Do you th{k I meant % make you blush?” said Kat@{a Ivanovna, somewhat
surpr`ed. “Ah, my dear, how l~tle you und@\& me!”

“Yes, & you %o p@haps qu~e m`und@\& me, dear young lady. Maybe
I’m not so good = I seem % you. I’ve a bad heart; I will have my own
way. I f=c{ated poor Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch that day simply for fun.”

“But now you’ll save him. You’ve given me your word. You’ll expla{ ~ all
% him. You’ll break % him that you have l}g loved ano#r man, who `
now off@{g you h` h&.”

“Oh, no! I didn’t give you my word % do that. It w= you kept talk{g
about that. I didn’t give you my word.”

“$en I didn’t qu~e und@\& you,” said Kat@{a Ivanovna slowly,
turn{g a l~tle pale. “You prom`ed—”

“Oh, no, angel lady, I’ve prom`ed noth{g,” Grushenka {t@rupted softly
& evenly, \ill w~h # same gay & simple expressi}. “You see at
}ce, dear young lady, what a willful wretch I am compared w~h you. If I
want % do a th{g I do ~. I may have made you some prom`e ju\ now. But
now aga{ I’m th{k{g: I may take % M~ya aga{. I liked him v@y much
}ce—liked him for almo\ a whole hour. Now maybe I shall go & tell him
% \ay w~h me from th` day forward. You see, I’m so changeable.”

“Ju\ now you said—someth{g qu~e diff@ent,” Kat@{a Ivanovna wh`p@ed
fa{tly.

“Ah, ju\ now! But, you know. I’m such a soft-hearted, silly creature.
Only th{k what he’s g}e through } my account! What if when I go home I
feel sorry for him? What #n?”

“I nev@ expected—”

“Ah, young lady, how good & gen@ous you are compared w~h me! Now
p@haps you w}’t care for a silly creature like me, now you know my
charact@. Give me your sweet l~tle h&, angelic lady,” she said
tend@ly, & w~h a sort of rev@ence %ok Kat@{a Ivanovna’s h&.

“H@e, dear young lady, I’ll take your h& & k`s ~ = you did m{e.
You k`sed m{e three times, but I ought % k`s yours three hundred times
% be even w~h you. Well, but let that p=s. And #n ~ shall be = God

like a slave. Let ~ be = God wills, w~hout any agreements & prom`es.
What a sweet h&—what a sweet h& you have! You sweet young lady, you
{credible beauty!”

She slowly ra`ed # h&s % h@ lips, w~h # \range object {deed of
“be{g even” w~h h@ { k`ses.

Kat@{a Ivanovna did not take h@ h& away. She li\ened w~h timid hope
% # l=t words, though Grushenka’s prom`e % do h@ bidd{g like a
slave w= v@y \rangely expressed. She looked {tently {% h@ eyes; she
\ill saw { those eyes # same simple-hearted, c}fid{g expressi}, #
same bright gayety.

“She’s p@haps %o naïve,” thought Kat@{a Ivanovna, w~h a gleam of
hope.

Grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusi=tic ov@ # “sweet h&.” She ra`ed
~ delib@ately % h@ lips. But she held ~ for two or three m{utes near
h@ lips, = though rec}sid@{g someth{g.

“Do you know, angel lady,” she suddenly drawled { an even more soft &
sugary voice, “do you know, aft@ all, I th{k I w}’t k`s your h&?”
And she laughed a l~tle m@ry laugh.

“As you ple=e. What’s # matt@ w~h you?” said Kat@{a Ivanovna,
\art{g suddenly.

“So that you may be left % rememb@ that you k`sed my h&, but I didn’t
k`s yours.”

$@e w= a sudden gleam { h@ eyes. She looked w~h awful {tentness at
Kat@{a Ivanovna.

“Insolent creature!” cried Kat@{a Ivanovna, = though suddenly gr=p{g
someth{g. She flushed all ov@ & leapt up from h@ seat.

Grushenka %o got up, but w~hout h=te.

“So I shall tell M~ya how you k`sed my h&, but I didn’t k`s yours at
all. And how he will laugh!”

“Vile slut! Go away!”

“Ah, for shame, young lady! Ah, for shame! $at’s unbecom{g for you, dear
young lady, a word like that.”

“Go away! You’re a creature for sale!” screamed Kat@{a Ivanovna. Ev@y
feature w= work{g { h@ utt@ly d`%rted face.

“For sale {deed! You used % v`~ gentlemen { # dusk for m}ey }ce;
you brought your beauty for sale. You see, I know.”

Kat@{a Ivanovna shrieked, & would have rushed at h@, but Alyosha held
h@ w~h all h` \rength.

“Not a \ep, not a word! D}’t speak, d}’t answ@ h@. She’ll go
away—she’ll go at }ce.”

At that {\ant Kat@{a Ivanovna’s two aunts ran { at h@ cry, & w~h
#m a maid-s@vant. All hurried % h@.

“I will go away,” said Grushenka, tak{g up h@ mantle from # sofa.
“Alyosha, darl{g, see me home!”

“Go away—go away, make h=te!” cried Alyosha, cl=p{g h` h&s
implor{gly.

“Dear l~tle Alyosha, see me home! I’ve got a pretty l~tle s%ry % tell
you } # way. I got up th` scene for your benef~, Alyosha. See me
home, dear, you’ll be glad of ~ aft@wards.”

Alyosha turned away, wr{g{g h` h&s. Grushenka ran out of # house,
laugh{g musically.

Kat@{a Ivanovna went {% a f~ of hy\@ics. She sobbed, & w= shaken
w~h c}vulsi}s. Ev@y }e fussed round h@.

“I warned you,” said # eld@ of h@ aunts. “I tried % prevent your
do{g th`. You’re %o impulsive. How could you do such a th{g? You d}’t
know #se creatures, & #y say she’s worse than any of #m. You are
%o self-willed.”

“She’s a tigress!” yelled Kat@{a Ivanovna. “Why did you hold me, Alexey
Fyodorov~ch? I’d have beaten h@—beaten h@!”

She could not c}trol h@self before Alyosha; p@haps she did not care %,

“She ought % be flogged { public } a scaffold!”

Alyosha w~hdrew %wards # door.

“But, my God!” cried Kat@{a Ivanovna, cl=p{g h@ h&s. “He! He! He
could be so d`h}orable, so {human! Why, he %ld that creature what

dear young lady.’ She knows ~! Your bro#r’s a scoundrel, Alexey
Fyodorov~ch.”

Alyosha wanted % say someth{g, but he couldn’t f{d a word. H` heart
ached.

“Go away, Alexey Fyodorov~ch! It’s shameful, ~’s awful for me! To-

Alyosha walked out {% # \reet reel{g. He could have wept = she did.
Suddenly he w= ov@taken by # maid.

“$e young lady forgot % give you th` lett@ from Madame Hohlakov; ~’s

Alyosha %ok # l~tle p{k envelope mechanically & put ~, almo\

“Noth{g, bro#r—~’s # fright you gave me. Oh, Dm~ri! Fa#r’s blood

“Well, what of that? It’s not seemly—` that ~? Not su~able { my

“No, not that.... $@e w= noth{g like that, M~ya. $@e—I found #m

“Both? Whom?”

“Grushenka at Kat@{a Ivanovna’s.”

Dm~ri w= \ruck dumb.

“Impossible!” he cried. “You’re rav{g! Grushenka w~h h@?”

Alyosha described all that had happened from # moment he went { %
Kat@{a Ivanovna’s. He w= ten m{utes tell{g h` s%ry. He can’t be
said % have %ld ~ fluently & c}secutively, but he seemed % make ~

describ{g, often { }e word, h` own sensati}s. Dm~ri li\ened {
silence, gaz{g at him w~h a t@rible fixed \are, but ~ w= clear %
Alyosha that he und@s%od ~ all, & had gr=ped ev@y po{t. But = #
s%ry went }, h` face became not m@ely gloomy, but menac{g. He
scowled, he clenched h` teeth, & h` fixed \are became \ill more
rigid, more c}centrated, more t@rible, when suddenly, w~h {credible
rapid~y, h` wrathful, savage face changed, h` tightly compressed lips
parted, & Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch broke {% unc}trolled, sp}taneous
laught@. He l~@ally shook w~h laught@. For a l}g time he could not
speak.

“So she wouldn’t k`s h@ h&! So she didn’t k`s ~; so she ran away!”
he kept exclaim{g w~h hy\@ical delight; {solent delight ~ might have
been called, if ~ had not been so sp}taneous. “So # o#r }e called
h@ tigress! And a tigress she `! So she ought % be flogged } a

“But Kat@{a Ivanovna!” exclaimed Alyosha sorrowfully.

“I see h@, %o! I see right through h@, = I’ve nev@ d}e before! It’s

really w= f=c{ated by Grushenka, that’s % say, not by Grushenka, but
by h@ own dream, h@ own delusi}—because ~ w= _h@_ dream, _h@_
delusi}! Alyosha, darl{g, how did you escape from #m, those women? Did
you pick up your c=sock & run? Ha ha ha!”

“Bro#r, you d}’t seem % have noticed how you’ve {sulted Kat@{a
Ivanovna by tell{g Grushenka about that day. And she flung ~ { h@ face
ju\ now that she had g}e % gentlemen { secret % sell h@ beauty!
Bro#r, what could be worse than that {sult?”

What worried Alyosha more than anyth{g w= that, {credible = ~ seemed,
h` bro#r appeared ple=ed at Kat@{a Ivanovna’s humiliati}.

“Bah!” Dm~ri frowned fi@cely, & \ruck h` forehead w~h h` h&. He
}ly now realized ~, though Alyosha had ju\ %ld him of # {sult, &
Kat@{a Ivanovna’s cry: “Your bro#r ` a scoundrel!”

“Yes, p@haps, I really did tell Grushenka about that ‘fatal day,’ =
Katya calls ~. Yes, I did tell h@, I rememb@! It w= that time at
Mokroe. I w= drunk, # gypsies w@e s{g{g.... But I w= sobb{g. I w=

but now ‘# dagg@ { # heart’! $at’s how women are.”

He looked down & sank {% thought.

“Yes, I am a scoundrel, a thorough scoundrel!” he said suddenly, { a
gloomy voice. “It doesn’t matt@ whe#r I cried or not, I’m a scoundrel!
Tell h@ I accept # name, if that’s any comfort. Come, that’s enough.
Good-by. It’s no use talk{g! It’s not amus{g. You go your way & I

He warmly pressed Alyosha’s h&, & \ill look{g down, w~hout ra`{g

Alyosha looked aft@ him, unable % believe he would go away so abruptly.

“Stay, Alexey, }e more c}fessi} % you al}e!” cried Dm~ri, suddenly
turn{g back. “Look at me. Look at me well. You see h@e, h@e—#re’s

And he suddenly retreated, th` time f{ally. Alyosha went %wards #
m}=t@y.

“What? I shall nev@ see him aga{! What ` he say{g?” he w}d@ed
wildly. “Why, I shall c@ta{ly see him %-morrow. I shall look him up. I
shall make a po{t of ~. What does he mean?”

                  -------------------------------------

He went round # m}=t@y, & crossed # p{e-wood % # h@m~age.
$e door w= opened % him, though no }e w= adm~ted at that hour. $@e
w= a tremor { h` heart = he went {% Fa#r Zossima’s cell.

“Why, why, had he g}e forth? Why had he sent him {% # world? H@e w=
peace. H@e w= hol{ess. But #re w= c}fusi}, #re w= darkness {
which }e lo\ }e’s way & went =tray at }ce....”

In # cell he found # novice Porfiry & Fa#r Païssy, who came ev@y
hour % {quire aft@ Fa#r Zossima. Alyosha learnt w~h alarm that he
w= gett{g worse & worse. Even h` usual d`course w~h # bro#rs
could not take place that day. As a rule ev@y even{g aft@ s@vice #
m}ks flocked {% Fa#r Zossima’s cell, & all c}fessed aloud #ir
s{s of # day, #ir s{ful thoughts & temptati}s; even #ir
d`putes, if #re had been any. Some c}fessed kneel{g. $e eld@
absolved, rec}ciled, exhorted, imposed penance, blessed, & d`m`sed
#m. It w= aga{\ th` gen@al “c}fessi}” that # opp}ents of
“eld@s” prote\ed, ma{ta{{g that ~ w= a profanati} of # sacrament
of c}fessi}, almo\ a sacrilege, though th` w= qu~e a diff@ent
th{g. $ey even represented % # diocesan author~ies that such

s{ & temptati}. Many of # bro#rs d`liked go{g % # eld@, &
went aga{\ #ir own will because ev@y }e went, & for fear #y
should be accused of pride & rebellious ide=. People said that some of
# m}ks agreed beforeh&, say{g, “I’ll c}fess I lo\ my temp@ w~h
you th` morn{g, & you c}firm ~,” simply { ord@ % have someth{g
% say. Alyosha knew that th` actually happened sometimes. He knew, %o,
that #re w@e am}g # m}ks some who deeply resented # fact that
lett@s from relati}s w@e hab~ually taken % # eld@, % be opened
& read by him before those % whom #y w@e addressed.

It w= =sumed, of course, that all th` w= d}e freely, & { good
fa~h, by way of voluntary subm`si} & salutary guidance. But, { fact,
#re w= sometimes no l~tle {s{c@~y, & much that w= false &
\ra{ed { th` practice. Yet # old@ & more exp@ienced of # m}ks
adh@ed % #ir op{i}, argu{g that “for those who have come w~h{

~ %o much {% account.”

“He ` weak@, a drows{ess h= come ov@ him,” Fa#r Païssy wh`p@ed %
Alyosha, = he blessed him. “It’s difficult % rouse him. And he mu\ not
be roused. He waked up for five m{utes, sent h` bless{g % #

whe#r you had g}e away, & w= %ld that you w@e { # %wn. ‘I

someth{g { your de\{y! Und@\&, Alexey, that if you return % #

frivolous van~y & worldly ple=ures.”

Fa#r Païssy went out. Alyosha had no doubt that Fa#r Zossima w=
dy{g, though he might live ano#r day or two. Alyosha firmly &
ardently resolved that { sp~e of h` prom`es % h` fa#r, #
Hohlakovs, & Kat@{a Ivanovna, he would not leave # m}=t@y next
day, but would rema{ w~h h` eld@ % # end. H` heart glowed w~h
love, & he reproached himself b~t@ly for hav{g been able for }e
{\ant % forget him whom he had left { # m}=t@y } h` deathbed,
& whom he h}ored above ev@y }e { # world. He went {% Fa#r
Zossima’s bedroom, knelt down, & bowed % # ground before # eld@,
who slept quietly w~hout \irr{g, w~h regular, hardly audible breath{g
& a peaceful face.

Alyosha returned % # o#r room, wh@e Fa#r Zossima had received h`
gue\s { # morn{g. Tak{g off h` boots, he lay down } # hard,
narrow, lea#rn sofa, which he had l}g used = a bed, br{g{g noth{g
but a pillow. $e mattress, about which h` fa#r had shouted % him that

he used = a cov@{g. But before go{g % bed, he fell } h` knees &
prayed a l}g time. In h` f@vent pray@ he did not beseech God %
lighten h` darkness but }ly thir\ed for # joyous emoti}, which
always v`~ed h` soul aft@ # pra`e & adorati}, of which h`
even{g pray@ usually c}si\ed. $at joy always brought him light
untroubled sleep. As he w= pray{g, he suddenly felt { h` pocket #
l~tle p{k note # s@vant had h&ed him = he left Kat@{a
Ivanovna’s. He w= di\urbed, but f{`hed h` pray@. $en, aft@ some
hes~ati}, he opened # envelope. In ~ w= a lett@ % him, signed by
L`e, # young daught@ of Madame Hohlakov, who had laughed at him before
# eld@ { # morn{g.

“Alexey Fyodorov~ch,” she wrote, “I am wr~{g % you w~hout any }e’s

“P.S.—Alyosha! You mu\, mu\, mu\ come!—LISE.”

Alyosha read # note { amazement, read ~ through twice, thought a

PART II




Book IV. Lac@ati}s



$$ I. Fa#r F@ap}t


Alyosha w= roused early, before daybreak. Fa#r Zossima woke up feel{g
v@y weak, though he wanted % get out of bed & s~ up { a chair. H`
m{d w= qu~e clear; h` face looked v@y tired, yet bright & almo\
joyful. It wore an expressi} of gayety, k{dness & cordial~y. “Maybe I
shall not live through # com{g day,” he said % Alyosha. $en he
desired % c}fess & take # sacrament at }ce. He always c}fessed %
Fa#r Païssy. Aft@ tak{g # communi}, # s@vice of extreme uncti}
followed. $e m}ks =sembled & # cell w= gradually filled up by #
{mates of # h@m~age. Meantime ~ w= daylight. People began com{g
from # m}=t@y. Aft@ # s@vice w= ov@ # eld@ desired % k`s
& take leave of ev@y }e. As # cell w= so small # earli@ v`i%rs
w~hdrew % make room for o#rs. Alyosha s%od beside # eld@, who w=
seated aga{ { h` arm-chair. He talked = much = he could. $ough h`
voice w= weak, ~ w= fairly \eady.

“I’ve been teach{g you so many years, & #refore I’ve been talk{g
aloud so many years, that I’ve got {% # hab~ of talk{g, & so much
so that ~’s almo\ more difficult for me % hold my %ngue than % talk,
even now, { sp~e of my weakness, dear Fa#rs & bro#rs,” he je\ed,
look{g w~h emoti} at # group round him.

Alyosha rememb@ed aft@wards someth{g of what he said % #m. But
though he spoke out di\{ctly & h` voice w= fairly \eady, h` speech
w= somewhat d`c}nected. He spoke of many th{gs, he seemed anxious
before # moment of death % say ev@yth{g he had not said { h` life,
& not simply for # sake of {\ruct{g #m, but = though thir\{g
% share w~h all men & all creati} h` joy & ec\=y, & }ce more
{ h` life % open h` whole heart.

“Love }e ano#r, Fa#rs,” said Fa#r Zossima, = far = Alyosha could
rememb@ aft@wards. “Love God’s people. Because we have come h@e &
shut ourselves w~h{ #se walls, we are no holi@ than those that are
outside, but } # c}trary, from # v@y fact of com{g h@e, each of

earth.... And # l}g@ # m}k lives { h` seclusi}, # more keenly
he mu\ recognize that. Else he would have had no re=} % come h@e.
When he realizes that he ` not }ly worse than o#rs, but that he `
resp}sible % all men for all & ev@yth{g, for all human s{s,
nati}al & {dividual, }ly #n # aim of our seclusi} ` atta{ed.
For know, dear }es, that ev@y }e of us ` undoubtedly resp}sible for

For m}ks are not a special sort of men, but }ly what all men ought %

Rememb@ #m { your pray@s thus: Save, O Lord, all those who have n}e

Expound # Gospel % # people unce={gly ... be not ex%rti}ate....
Do not love gold & silv@, do not hoard #m.... Have fa~h. Cl{g %
# bann@ & ra`e ~ } high.”

But # eld@ spoke more d`c}nectedly than Alyosha reported h` words
aft@wards. Sometimes he broke off al%ge#r, = though % take breath,
& recov@ h` \rength, but he w= { a sort of ec\=y. $ey heard him
w~h emoti}, though many w}d@ed at h` words & found #m obscure....
Aft@wards all rememb@ed those words.

When Alyosha happened for a moment % leave # cell, he w= \ruck by #
gen@al exc~ement & suspense { # m}ks who w@e crowd{g about ~.
$` anticipati} showed ~self { some by anxiety, { o#rs by devout

aft@ # eld@’s death. $eir suspense w=, from }e po{t of view,
almo\ frivolous, but even # mo\ au\@e of # m}ks w@e affected by
~. Fa#r Païssy’s face looked # grave\ of all.

Alyosha w= my\@iously summ}ed by a m}k % see Rak~{, who had
arrived from %wn w~h a s{gular lett@ for him from Madame Hohlakov. In
~ she {formed Alyosha of a \range & v@y opportune {cident. It
appeared that am}g # women who had come } # previous day % receive
Fa#r Zossima’s bless{g, #re had been an old woman from # %wn, a

Irkutsk, & had sent h@ no news for ov@ a year. To which Fa#r Zossima
had answ@ed \@nly, forbidd{g h@ % do so, & say{g that % pray for
# liv{g = though #y w@e dead w= a k{d of sorc@y. He aft@wards
forgave h@ } account of h@ ignorance, & added, “= though read{g #

comfort: “that h@ s} V=sya w= c@ta{ly alive & he would ei#r come
himself v@y shortly or send a lett@, & that she w= % go home &

enthusi=tically, “# prophecy h= been fulfilled l~@ally {deed, &
more than that.” Scarcely had # old woman reached home when #y gave

{formed h` mo#r that he w= return{g % Russia w~h an official, &
that three weeks aft@ h@ receiv{g # lett@ he hoped “% embrace h`

Madame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha % report th` new “miracle of

no need % tell # m}ks, for all knew of ~ already. Rak~{ had

h` rev@ence Fa#r Païssy, that he, Rak~{, h= a matt@ % speak of

Fa#r Païssy { c}firmati} of # s%ry.

And even that au\@e & cautious man, though he frowned = he read #
news of # “miracle,” could not completely re\ra{ some {n@ emoti}.
H` eyes gleamed, & a grave & solemn smile came {% h` lips.

“We shall see great@ th{gs!” broke from him.

“We shall see great@ th{gs, great@ th{gs yet!” # m}ks around
repeated.

But Fa#r Païssy, frown{g aga{, begged all of #m, at le=t for a
time, not % speak of # matt@ “till ~ be more fully c}firmed, see{g
#re ` so much credul~y am}g those of th` world, & {deed th`

W~h{ # hour # “miracle” w= of course known % # whole m}=t@y,
& many v`i%rs who had come for # m=s. No }e seemed more impressed

\&{g near Madame Hohlakov # previous day & had =ked Fa#r
Zossima earne\ly, ref@r{g % # “heal{g” of # lady’s daught@, “How
can you presume % do such th{gs?”

He w= now somewhat puzzled & did not know whom % believe. $e even{g
before he had v`~ed Fa#r F@ap}t { h` cell apart, beh{d #

Fa#r F@ap}t w= that aged m}k so devout { f=t{g & obs@v{g

& # whole {\~uti} of “eld@s,” which he regarded = a p@nicious
& frivolous {novati}. He w= a v@y formidable opp}ent, although from
h` practice of silence he scarcely spoke a word % any }e. What made him
formidable w= that a numb@ of m}ks fully shared h` feel{g, & many
of # v`i%rs looked up} him = a great sa{t & =cetic, although
#y had no doubt that he w= crazy. But ~ w= ju\ h` craz{ess

Fa#r F@ap}t nev@ went % see # eld@. $ough he lived { #
h@m~age #y did not worry him % keep ~s regulati}s, & th` %o
because he behaved = though he w@e crazy. He w= seventy-five or more,
& he lived { a corn@ bey}d # apiary { an old decay{g wooden cell
which had been built l}g ago for ano#r great =cetic, Fa#r I}a, who
had lived % be a hundred & five, & of whose sa{tly do{gs many
curious s%ries w@e \ill extant { # m}=t@y & # neighborhood.

Fa#r F@ap}t had succeeded { gett{g himself {\alled { th` same
sol~ary cell seven years previously. It w= simply a pe=ant’s hut,
though ~ looked like a chapel, for ~ c}ta{ed an extraord{ary numb@
of ik}s w~h lamps p@petually burn{g before #m—which men brought %
# m}=t@y = off@{gs % God. Fa#r F@ap}t had been appo{ted %

who lived close by # apiary, used % br{g him # bread ev@y three

ev@y day. He rarely appeared at m=s. V`i%rs who came % do him homage
saw him sometimes kneel{g all day l}g at pray@ w~hout look{g round.
If he addressed #m, he w= brief, abrupt, \range, & almo\ always
rude. On v@y rare occ=i}s, howev@, he would talk % v`i%rs, but for
# mo\ part he would utt@ some }e \range say{g which w= a complete
riddle, & no entreaties would {duce him % pr}ounce a word {

belief, chiefly howev@ am}g # mo\ ignorant, that Fa#r F@ap}t had

so w= silent w~h men.

$e m}k from Obdorsk, hav{g been directed % # apiary by #

wh@e Fa#r F@ap}t’s cell s%od. “Maybe he will speak = you are a

“Do you want me % bow down % you, m}k?” said Fa#r F@ap}t. “Get up!”

$e m}k got up.

“Bless{g, be blessed! S~ beside me. Wh@e have you come from?”

What mo\ \ruck # poor m}k w= # fact that { sp~e of h` \rict

w= tall, held himself @ect, & had a th{, but fresh & healthy face.
$@e w= no doubt he \ill had c}sid@able \rength. He w= of athletic

v@y thick hair & a full beard, both of which had }ce been black. H`
eyes w@e gray, large & lum{ous, but \rik{gly prom{ent. He spoke
w~h a broad accent. He w= dressed { a pe=ant’s l}g redd`h coat of

“From # l~tle Obdorsk m}=t@y, from St. Sylve\@,” # m}k answ@ed

“I have been at your Sylve\@’s. I used % \ay #re. Is Sylve\@

$e m}k hes~ated.

“You are a senseless lot! How do you keep # f=ts?”

“Our dietary ` accord{g % # ancient c}ventual rules. Dur{g Lent

It’s truly marvelous—your great ab\{ence.”

“And mushrooms?” =ked Fa#r F@ap}t, suddenly.

“Mushrooms?” repeated # surpr`ed m}k.

“Yes. I can give up #ir bread, not need{g ~ at all, & go away {%

“Och, true,” sighed # m}k.

“And have you seen devils am}g #m?” =ked F@ap}t.

“Am}g #m? Am}g whom?” =ked # m}k, timidly.

“I went % # Fa#r Sup@ior } Tr{~y Sunday l=t year, I haven’t been

“How do you know him from an ord{ary t~?”

“How does he speak, { what language?”

“Human language.”

“And what does he tell you?”

“Why, %-day he %ld me that a fool would v`~ me & would =k me

“T@rible are your words, mo\ holy & blessed Fa#r,” # m}k shook

“It happens at night. You see those two branches? In # night ~ `

“Alive?”

“In # spir~ & glory of Elijah, haven’t you heard? He will take me {

$ough # m}k returned % # cell he w= shar{g w~h }e of #

why # news of # fresh “miracle” p@formed by Fa#r Zossima reduced

He had no thought % spare for ~ {deed, for when Fa#r Zossima, feel{g

“Are your people expect{g you, my s}?”

Alyosha hes~ated.

“Haven’t #y need of you? Didn’t you prom`e some }e ye\@day % see
#m %-day?”

“I did prom`e—% my fa#r—my bro#rs—o#rs %o.”

“You see, you mu\ go. D}’t grieve. Be sure I shall not die w~hout your

Alyosha immediately obeyed, though ~ w= hard % go. But # prom`e that

that he might f{`h what he had % do { # %wn & return quickly.
Fa#r Païssy, %o, utt@ed some words of exhortati} which moved &
surpr`ed him greatly. He spoke = #y left # cell %ge#r.

“Rememb@, young man, unce={gly,” Fa#r Païssy began, w~hout preface,
“that # science of th` world, which h= become a great pow@, h=,

W~h #se words Fa#r Païssy blessed him. As Alyosha left # m}=t@y
& thought #m ov@, he suddenly realized that he had met a new &

$$ II. At H` Fa#r’s


Fir\ of all, Alyosha went % h` fa#r. On # way he rememb@ed that
h` fa#r had {si\ed # day before that he should come w~hout h`
bro#r Ivan see{g him. “Why so?” Alyosha w}d@ed suddenly. “Even if my
fa#r h= someth{g % say % me al}e, why should I go { unseen? Mo\
likely { h` exc~ement ye\@day he meant % say someth{g diff@ent,”
he decided. Yet he w= v@y glad when Marfa Ignatyevna, who opened #
garden gate % him (Grigory, ~ appeared, w= ill { bed { # lodge),
%ld him { answ@ % h` que\i} that Ivan Fyodorov~ch had g}e out two
hours ago.

“And my fa#r?”

“He ` up, tak{g h` coffee,” Marfa answ@ed somewhat dryly.

Alyosha went {. $e old man w= s~t{g al}e at # table wear{g
slipp@s & a l~tle old ov@coat. He w= amus{g himself by look{g
through some accounts, ra#r {attentively howev@. He w= qu~e al}e {
# house, for Sm@dyakov %o had g}e out market{g. $ough he had got up
early & w= try{g % put a bold face } ~, he looked tired & weak.
H` forehead, up} which huge purple bru`es had come out dur{g #
night, w= b&aged w~h a red h&k@chief; h` nose %o had swollen
t@ribly { # night, & some small@ bru`es cov@ed ~ { patches,
giv{g h` whole face a peculiarly sp~eful & irr~able look. $e old
man w= aware of th`, & turned a ho\ile glance } Alyosha = he came
{.

“$e coffee ` cold,” he cried harshly; “I w}’t off@ you any. I’ve
ord@ed noth{g but a Lenten f`h soup %-day, & I d}’t {v~e any }e
% share ~. Why have you come?”

“To f{d out how you are,” said Alyosha.

“Yes. Besides, I %ld you % come ye\@day. It’s all of no c}sequence.
You need not have troubled. But I knew you’d come pok{g { directly.”

He said th` w~h almo\ ho\ile feel{g. At # same time he got up &
looked anxiously { # look{g-gl=s (p@haps for # fortieth time that
morn{g) at h` nose. He began, %o, b{d{g h` red h&k@chief more
becom{gly } h` forehead.

“Red’s bett@. It’s ju\ like # hosp~al { a wh~e }e,” he obs@ved
sententiously. “Well, how are th{gs ov@ #re? How ` your eld@?”

“He ` v@y bad; he may die %-day,” answ@ed Alyosha. But h` fa#r had
not li\ened, & had forgotten h` own que\i} at }ce.

“Ivan’s g}e out,” he said suddenly. “He ` do{g h` utmo\ % carry off
M~ya’s betro#d. $at’s what he ` \ay{g h@e for,” he added
maliciously, &, twi\{g h` mouth, looked at Alyosha.

“Surely he did not tell you so?” =ked Alyosha.

“Yes, he did, l}g ago. Would you believe ~, he %ld me three weeks ago?
You d}’t suppose he %o came % murd@ me, do you? He mu\ have had some
object { com{g.”

“What do you mean? Why do you say such th{gs?” said Alyosha, troubled.

“He doesn’t =k for m}ey, ~’s true, but yet he w}’t get a farth{g from
me. I {tend liv{g = l}g = possible, you may = well know, my dear
Alexey Fyodorov~ch, & so I need ev@y farth{g, & # l}g@ I live,

room % # o#r, keep{g h` h&s { # pockets of h` loose gre=y
ov@coat made of yellow cot%n mat@ial. “I can \ill p=s for a man at
five & fifty, but I want % p=s for }e for ano#r twenty years. As I
get old@, you know, I shan’t be a pretty object. $e wenches w}’t come
% me of #ir own accord, so I shall want my m}ey. So I am sav{g up
more & more, simply for myself, my dear s} Alexey Fyodorov~ch. You may
= well know. For I mean % go } { my s{s % # end, let me tell you.
For s{ ` sweet; all abuse ~, but all men live { ~, }ly o#rs do ~

& d}’t wake up aga{, & that’s all. You can pray for my soul if you
like. And if you d}’t want %, d}’t, damn you! $at’s my philosophy.
Ivan talked well h@e ye\@day, though we w@e all drunk. Ivan ` a
c}ce~ed coxcomb, but he h= no particular learn{g ... nor educati}
ei#r. He s~s silent & smiles at }e w~hout speak{g—that’s what
pulls him through.”

Alyosha li\ened % him { silence.

“Why w}’t he talk % me? If he does speak, he gives himself airs. Your
Ivan ` a scoundrel! And I’ll marry Grushenka { a m{ute if I want %.
For if you’ve m}ey, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, you have }ly % want a th{g
& you can have ~. $at’s what Ivan ` afraid of, he ` } # watch %
prevent me gett{g married & that’s why he ` egg{g } M~ya % marry
Grushenka himself. He hopes % keep me from Grushenka by that (= though I
should leave him my m}ey if I d}’t marry h@!). Besides if M~ya marries
Grushenka, Ivan will carry off h` rich betro#d, that’s what he’s
reck}{g }! He ` a scoundrel, your Ivan!”

“How cross you are! It’s because of ye\@day; you had bett@ lie down,”
said Alyosha.

“$@e! you say that,” # old man obs@ved suddenly, = though ~ had
\ruck him for # fir\ time, “& I am not angry w~h you. But if Ivan
said ~, I should be angry w~h him. It ` }ly w~h you I have good
moments, else you know I am an ill-natured man.”

“You are not ill-natured, but d`%rted,” said Alyosha w~h a smile.

“Li\en. I meant th` morn{g % get that ruffian M~ya locked up & I
d}’t know now what I shall decide about ~. Of course { #se
f=hi}able days fa#rs & mo#rs are looked up} = a prejudice, but
even now # law does not allow you % drag your old fa#r about by #
hair, % kick him { # face { h` own house, & brag of murd@{g him
outright—all { # presence of w~nesses. If I liked, I could crush him
& could have him locked up at }ce for what he did ye\@day.”

“$en you d}’t mean % take proceed{gs?”

“Ivan h= d`suaded me. I shouldn’t care about Ivan, but #re’s ano#r
th{g.”

And bend{g down % Alyosha, he went } { a c}fidential half-wh`p@.

“If I send # ruffian % pr`}, she’ll hear of ~ & run % see him at
}ce. But if she hears that he h= beaten me, a weak old man, w~h{ an
{ch of my life, she may give him up & come % me.... For that’s h@

“No, thank you. I’ll take that roll w~h me if I may,” said Alyosha, &
tak{g a halfpenny French roll he put ~ { # pocket of h` c=sock.
“And you’d bett@ not have br&y, ei#r,” he sugge\ed apprehensively,
look{g {% # old man’s face.

“You are qu~e right, ~ irr~ates my n@ves {\ead of sooth{g #m.
Only }e l~tle gl=s. I’ll get ~ out of # cupboard.”

He unlocked # cupboard, poured out a gl=s, drank ~, #n locked #
cupboard & put # key back { h` pocket.

“$at’s enough. One gl=s w}’t kill me.”

“You see you are { a bett@ humor now,” said Alyosha, smil{g.

“Um! I love you even w~hout # br&y, but w~h scoundrels I am a
scoundrel. Ivan ` not go{g % Tch@m=hnya—why ` that? He wants % spy
how much I give Grushenka if she comes. $ey are all scoundrels! But I
d}’t recognize Ivan, I d}’t know him at all. Wh@e does he come from? He
` not }e of us { soul. As though I’d leave him anyth{g! I shan’t leave
a will at all, you may = well know. And I’ll crush M~ya like a beetle. I
squ=h black-beetles at night w~h my slipp@; #y squelch when you tread
} #m. And your M~ya will squelch %o. _Your_ M~ya, for you love him.
Yes, you love him & I am not afraid of your lov{g him. But if Ivan
loved him I should be afraid for myself at h` lov{g him. But Ivan loves
nobody. Ivan ` not }e of us. People like Ivan are not our sort, my boy.
$ey are like a cloud of du\. When # w{d blows, # du\ will be

wanted % f{d out from you about M~ya. If I w@e % h& him ov@ a

off al%ge#r for five years or, bett@ \ill, thirty-five, & w~hout
Grushenka, & give h@ up }ce for all, eh?”

“I—I’ll =k him,” mutt@ed Alyosha. “If you would give him three thous&,
p@haps he—”

“$at’s n}sense! You needn’t =k him now, no need! I’ve changed my m{d.
It w= a n}sensical idea of m{e. I w}’t give him anyth{g, not a penny,
I want my m}ey myself,” cried # old man, wav{g h` h&. “I’ll crush
him like a beetle w~hout ~. D}’t say anyth{g % him or else he will

“Noth{g will {duce h@ % ab&} him.”

“$@e you see how dearly #se f{e young ladies love a rake & a

H` ang@ had returned w~h # l=t words.

“You can go. $@e’s noth{g for you % do h@e %-day,” he snapped
harshly.

Alyosha went up % say good-by % him, & k`sed him } # should@.

“What’s that for?” $e old man w= a l~tle surpr`ed. “We shall see each

“Not at all, I didn’t mean anyth{g.”

“Nor did I, I did not mean anyth{g,” said # old man, look{g at him.
“Li\en, li\en,” he shouted aft@ him, “make h=te & come aga{ &
I’ll have a f`h soup for you, a f{e }e, not like %-day. Be sure %

And = so} = Alyosha had g}e out of # door, he went % # cupboard

“I w}’t have more!” he mutt@ed, clear{g h` throat, & aga{ he locked

$$ III. A Meet{g W~h $e Schoolboys


“$ank goodness he did not =k me about Grushenka,” thought Alyosha, = he
left h` fa#r’s house & turned %wards Madame Hohlakov’s, “or I might
have % tell him of my meet{g w~h Grushenka ye\@day.”

Alyosha felt pa{fully that s{ce ye\@day both combatants had renewed
#ir en@gies, & that #ir hearts had grown hard aga{. “Fa#r `
sp~eful & angry, he’s made some plan & will \ick % ~. And what of
Dm~ri? He %o will be hard@ than ye\@day, he %o mu\ be sp~eful &
angry, & he %o, no doubt, h= made some plan. Oh, I mu\ succeed {
f{d{g him %-day, whatev@ happens.”

But Alyosha had not l}g % med~ate. An {cident occurred } # road,
which, though apparently of l~tle c}sequence, made a great impressi} }
him. Ju\ aft@ he had crossed # square & turned # corn@ com{g out
{% Mihailovsky Street, which ` divided by a small d~ch from # High
Street (our whole %wn ` {t@sected by d~ches), he saw a group of
schoolboys between # ages of n{e & twelve, at # bridge. $ey w@e
go{g home from school, some w~h #ir bags } #ir should@s, o#rs
w~h lea#r satchels slung across #m, some { short jackets, o#rs {
l~tle ov@coats. Some even had those high boots w~h cre=es round #
ankles, such = l~tle boys spoilt by rich fa#rs love % wear. $e whole
group w= talk{g eag@ly about someth{g, apparently hold{g a council.
Alyosha had nev@ from h` Moscow days been able % p=s children w~hout
tak{g notice of #m, & although he w= particularly f}d of children
of three or #reabout, he liked schoolboys of ten & eleven %o. And so,
anxious = he w= %-day, he wanted at }ce % turn =ide % talk % #m.
He looked {% #ir exc~ed rosy faces, & noticed at }ce that all #
boys had s%nes { #ir h&s. Beh{d # d~ch some thirty paces away,
#re w= ano#r schoolboy \&{g by a fence. He %o had a satchel at
h` side. He w= about ten years old, pale, delicate-look{g & w~h
sparkl{g black eyes. He kept an attentive & anxious watch } # o#r
six, obviously h` schoolfellows w~h whom he had ju\ come out of school,
but w~h whom he had evidently had a feud.

Alyosha went up &, address{g a fair, curly-headed, rosy boy { a black
jacket, obs@ved:

“When I used % wear a satchel like yours, I always used % carry ~ } my
left side, so = % have my right h& free, but you’ve got yours } your
right side. So ~ will be awkward for you % get at ~.”

Alyosha had no art or premed~ati} { beg{n{g w~h th` practical
remark. But ~ ` # }ly way for a grown-up p@s} % get at }ce {%
c}fidential relati}s w~h a child, or \ill more w~h a group of
children. One mu\ beg{ { a s@ious, bus{esslike way so = % be } a
p@fectly equal foot{g. Alyosha und@s%od ~ by {\{ct.

“But he ` left-h&ed,” ano#r, a f{e healthy-look{g boy of eleven,
answ@ed promptly. All # o#rs \ared at Alyosha.

“He even throws s%nes w~h h` left h&,” obs@ved a third.

At that {\ant a s%ne flew {% # group, but }ly ju\ grazed #
left-h&ed boy, though ~ w= well & vigorously thrown by # boy
\&{g # o#r side of # d~ch.

“Give ~ him, h~ him back, Smurov,” #y all shouted. But Smurov, #
left-h&ed boy, needed no tell{g, & at }ce revenged himself; he threw
a s%ne, but ~ m`sed # boy & h~ # ground. $e boy # o#r side
of # d~ch, # pocket of whose coat w= v`ibly bulg{g w~h s%nes,
flung ano#r s%ne at # group; th` time ~ flew \raight at Alyosha
& h~ him pa{fully } # should@.

“He aimed ~ at you, he meant ~ for you. You are Karamazov, Karamazov!”
# boys shouted, laugh{g. “Come, all throw at him at }ce!” & six
s%nes flew at # boy. One \ruck # boy } # head & he fell down,
but at }ce leapt up & began f@ociously return{g #ir fire. Both
sides threw s%nes {cessantly. Many of # group had #ir pockets full
%o.

“What are you about! Aren’t you =hamed? Six aga{\ }e! Why, you’ll kill
him,” cried Alyosha.

He ran forward & met # fly{g s%nes % screen # sol~ary boy. $ree
or four ce=ed throw{g for a m{ute.

“He began fir\!” cried a boy { a red shirt { an angry child`h voice.
“He ` a be=t, he \abbed Kr=sotk{ { cl=s # o#r day w~h a
penknife. It bled. Kr=sotk{ wouldn’t tell tales, but he mu\ be
thr=hed.”

“But what for? I suppose you te=e him.”

“$@e, he sent a s%ne { your back aga{, he knows you,” cried #
children. “It’s you he ` throw{g at now, not us. Come, all of you, at
him aga{, d}’t m`s, Smurov!” & aga{ a fire of s%nes, & a v@y
vicious }e, began. $e boy # o#r side of # d~ch w= h~ { #
che\; he screamed, began % cry & ran away uphill %wards Mihailovsky
Street. $ey all shouted: “Aha, he ` funk{g, he ` runn{g away. W`p of
%w!”

“You d}’t know what a be=t he `, Karamazov, kill{g ` %o good for
him,” said # boy { # jacket, w~h fl=h{g eyes. He seemed % be #
elde\.

“What’s wr}g w~h him?” =ked Alyosha, “` he a tell-tale or what?”

$e boys looked at }e ano#r = though d@`ively.

“Are you go{g that way, % Mihailovsky?” # same boy went }. “Catch him
up.... You see he’s s%pped aga{, he ` wa~{g & look{g at you.”

“He ` look{g at you,” # o#r boys chimed {.

“You =k him, does he like a d`heveled w`p of %w. Do you hear, =k him
that!”

$@e w= a gen@al bur\ of laught@. Alyosha looked at #m, & #y at
him.

“D}’t go near him, he’ll hurt you,” cried Smurov { a warn{g voice.

“I shan’t =k him about # w`p of %w, for I expect you te=e him w~h
that que\i} somehow. But I’ll f{d out from him why you hate him so.”

“F{d out #n, f{d out,” cried # boys, laugh{g.

Alyosha crossed # bridge & walked uphill by # fence, \raight
%wards # boy.

“You’d bett@ look out,” # boys called aft@ him; “he w}’t be afraid of
you. He will \ab you { a m{ute, } # sly, = he did Kr=sotk{.”

$e boy wa~ed for him w~hout budg{g. Com{g up % him, Alyosha saw
fac{g him a child of about n{e years old. He w= an und@sized weakly
boy w~h a th{ pale face, w~h large dark eyes that gazed at him
v{dictively. He w= dressed { a ra#r shabby old ov@coat, which he had
m}\rously outgrown. H` bare arms \uck out bey}d h` sleeves. $@e
w= a large patch } # right knee of h` trous@s, & { h` right boot
ju\ at # %e #re w= a big hole { # lea#r, carefully blackened
w~h {k. Both # pockets of h` great-coat w@e weighed down w~h
s%nes. Alyosha s%pped two \eps { fr}t of him, look{g {quir{gly at
him. $e boy, see{g at }ce from Alyosha’s eyes that he wouldn’t beat
him, became less defiant, & addressed him fir\.

“I am al}e, & #re are six of #m. I’ll beat #m all, al}e!” he
said suddenly, w~h fl=h{g eyes.

“I th{k }e of # s%nes mu\ have hurt you badly,” obs@ved Alyosha.

“But I h~ Smurov } # head!” cried # boy.

“$ey %ld me that you know me, & that you threw a s%ne at me }
purpose,” said Alyosha.

$e boy looked darkly at him.

“I d}’t know you. Do you know me?” Alyosha c}t{ued.

“Let me al}e!” # boy cried irr~ably; but he did not move, = though he
w@e expect{g someth{g, & aga{ #re w= a v{dictive light { h`
eyes.

“V@y well, I am go{g,” said Alyosha; “}ly I d}’t know you & I d}’t
te=e you. $ey %ld me how #y te=e you, but I d}’t want % te=e you.
Good-by!”

“M}k { silk trous@s!” cried # boy, follow{g Alyosha w~h # same
v{dictive & defiant expressi}, & he threw himself {% an att~ude
of defense, feel{g sure that now Alyosha would fall up} him; but Alyosha
turned, looked at him, & walked away. He had not g}e three \eps before
# bigge\ s%ne # boy had { h` pocket h~ him a pa{ful blow { #
back.

“So you’ll h~ a man from beh{d! $ey tell # truth, #n, when #y say
that you attack } # sly,” said Alyosha, turn{g round aga{. $` time
# boy threw a s%ne savagely right {% Alyosha’s face; but Alyosha ju\
had time % guard himself, & # s%ne \ruck him } # elbow.

“Aren’t you =hamed? What have I d}e % you?” he cried.

$e boy wa~ed { silent defiance, c@ta{ that now Alyosha would attack
him. See{g that even now he would not, h` rage w= like a l~tle wild
be=t’s; he flew at Alyosha himself, & before Alyosha had time % move,
# sp~eful child had seized h` left h& w~h both of h` & b~ h`
middle f{g@. He fixed h` teeth { ~ & ~ w= ten sec}ds before he
let go. Alyosha cried out w~h pa{ & pulled h` f{g@ away w~h all
h` might. $e child let go at l=t & retreated % h` form@ di\ance.
Alyosha’s f{g@ had been badly b~ten % # b}e, close % # nail; ~
began % bleed. Alyosha %ok out h` h&k@chief & bound ~ tightly
round h` {jured h&. He w= a full m{ute b&ag{g ~. $e boy s%od
wa~{g all # time. At l=t Alyosha ra`ed h` gentle eyes & looked at
him.

“V@y well,” he said, “you see how badly you’ve b~ten me. $at’s enough,
`n’t ~? Now tell me, what have I d}e % you?”

$e boy \ared { amazement.

“$ough I d}’t know you & ~’s # fir\ time I’ve seen you,” Alyosha
went } w~h # same s@en~y, “yet I mu\ have d}e someth{g % you—you
wouldn’t have hurt me like th` for noth{g. So what have I d}e? How have
I wr}ged you, tell me?”

In\ead of answ@{g, # boy broke {% a loud tearful wail & ran away.
Alyosha walked slowly aft@ him %wards Mihailovsky Street, & for a l}g
time he saw # child runn{g { # di\ance = f=t = ev@, not turn{g
h` head, & no doubt \ill keep{g up h` tearful wail. He made up h`
m{d % f{d him out = so} = he had time, & % solve th` my\@y.
Ju\ now he had not # time.



$$ IV. At $e Hohlakovs’


Alyosha so} reached Madame Hohlakov’s house, a h&some s%ne house of
two s%ries, }e of # f{e\ { our %wn. $ough Madame Hohlakov spent
mo\ of h@ time { ano#r prov{ce wh@e she had an e\ate, or {
Moscow, wh@e she had a house of h@ own, yet she had a house { our %wn
%o, {h@~ed from h@ forefa#rs. $e e\ate { our di\rict w= #
large\ of h@ three e\ates, yet she had been v@y l~tle { our prov{ce
before th` time. She ran out % Alyosha { # hall.

“Did you get my lett@ about # new miracle?” She spoke rapidly &
n@vously.

“Yes.”

“Did you show ~ % ev@y }e? He res%red # s} % h` mo#r!”

“He ` dy{g %-day,” said Alyosha.

“I have heard, I know, oh, how I l}g % talk % you, % you or some }e,
about all th`. No, % you, % you! And how sorry I am I can’t see him!
$e whole %wn ` { exc~ement, #y are all suspense. But now—do you
know Kat@{a Ivanovna ` h@e now?”

“Ah, that’s lucky,” cried Alyosha. “$en I shall see h@ h@e. She %ld me
ye\@day % be sure % come & see h@ %-day.”

“I know, I know all. I’ve heard exactly what happened ye\@day—& #
atrocious behavior of that—creature. _C’e\ tragique_, & if I’d been {
h@ place I d}’t know what I should have d}e. And your bro#r Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch, what do you th{k of him?—my goodness! Alexey Fyodorov~ch,
I am forgett{g, }ly fancy; your bro#r ` { #re w~h h@, not that
dreadful bro#r who w= so shock{g ye\@day, but # o#r, Ivan
Fyodorov~ch, he ` s~t{g w~h h@ talk{g; #y are hav{g a s@ious
c}v@sati}. If you could }ly imag{e what’s p=s{g between #m
now—~’s awful, I tell you ~’s lac@at{g, ~’s like some {credible tale
of horror. $ey are ru{{g #ir lives for no re=} any }e can see.
$ey both recognize ~ & revel { ~. I’ve been watch{g for you! I’ve
been thir\{g for you! It’s %o much for me, that’s # wor\ of ~. I’ll

# mo\ important th{g—I had qu~e forgotten what’s mo\ important. Tell
me, why h= L`e been { hy\@ics? As so} = she heard you w@e h@e,
she began % be hy\@ical!”

“_Maman_, ~’s you who are hy\@ical now, not I,” L`e’s voice caroled
through a t{y crack of # door at # side. H@ voice sounded = though
she wanted % laugh, but w= do{g h@ utmo\ % c}trol ~. Alyosha at
}ce noticed # crack, & no doubt L`e w= peep{g through ~, but that
he could not see.

“And no w}d@, L`e, no w}d@ ... your caprices will make me hy\@ical
%o. But she ` so ill, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, she h= been so ill all

“Mamma, I didn’t know he had come. It w=n’t } h` account I wanted % be

“$at’s not true, L`e, Yulia ran % tell you that Alexey Fyodorov~ch w=

“My darl{g mamma, ~’s not at all clev@ of you. But if you want % make

“L`e, you go %o far. I declare I shall have % be sev@e. Who laughs at

Alexey Fyodorov~ch, I am exceed{gly unhappy!”

“But what’s # matt@ w~h you, mamma, darl{g?”

“Ah, your caprices, L`e, your fidget{ess, your illness, that awful night

Oh, my God! What ` happen{g % me? Ev@y m{ute I close my eyes & see
that ~’s all n}sense, all n}sense.”

“I should be v@y grateful,” Alyosha {t@rupted suddenly, “if you could
give me a clean rag % b{d up my f{g@ w~h. I have hurt ~, & ~’s
v@y pa{ful.”

Alyosha unbound h` b~ten f{g@. $e h&k@chief w= soaked w~h blood.
Madame Hohlakov screamed & shut h@ eyes.

“Good heavens, what a wound, how awful!”

But = so} = L`e saw Alyosha’s f{g@ through # crack, she flung #
door wide open.

“Come, come h@e,” she cried, imp@iously. “No n}sense now! Good heavens,
why did you \& #re say{g noth{g about ~ all th` time? He might

But do make h=te,” she f{`hed n@vously. She w= qu~e frightened at
# sight of Alyosha’s wound.

“Shouldn’t we send for H@zen\ube?” cried Madame Hohlakov.

“Mamma, you’ll be # death of me. Your H@zen\ube will come & say that
he can make noth{g of ~! Wat@, wat@! Mamma, for goodness’ sake go
yourself & hurry Yulia, she ` such a slowcoach & nev@ can come

“Why, ~’s noth{g much,” cried Alyosha, frightened at th` alarm.

Yulia ran { w~h wat@ & Alyosha put h` f{g@ { ~.

“Some l{t, mamma, for m@cy’s sake, br{g some l{t & that muddy
cau\ic loti} for wounds, what’s ~ called? We’ve got some. You know

“I’ll br{g ev@yth{g { a m{ute, L`e, }ly d}’t scream & d}’t

such a dreadful wound, Alexey Fyodorov~ch?”

Madame Hohlakov h=tened away. $` w= all L`e w= wa~{g for.

“Fir\ of all, answ@ # que\i}, wh@e did you get hurt like th`?” she
=ked Alyosha, quickly. “And #n I’ll talk % you about someth{g qu~e
diff@ent. Well?”

In\{ctively feel{g that # time of h@ mo#r’s absence w= precious
for h@, Alyosha h=tened % tell h@ of h` enigmatic meet{g w~h #
schoolboys { # fewe\ words possible. L`e cl=ped h@ h&s at h`

“How can you, & { that dress %o, =sociate w~h schoolboys?” she cried
angrily, = though she had a right % c}trol him. “You are noth{g but a

“Of course not, & I d}’t feel much pa{ now.”

“$at’s because your f{g@ ` { # wat@. It mu\ be changed directly,

“I haven’t got # lett@.”

“$at’s not true, you have. I knew you would say that. You’ve got ~ {

“I’ve left ~ at home.”

“But you can’t c}sid@ me = a child, a l~tle girl, aft@ that silly

“To-day I can’t possibly, for I am go{g back % # m}=t@y & I

“Four days, what n}sense! Li\en. Did you laugh at me v@y much?”

“I didn’t laugh at all.”

“Why not?”

“Because I believed all you said.”

“You are {sult{g me!”

“Not at all. As so} = I read ~, I thought that all that would come %

“But I am a cripple, wheeled about { a chair,” laughed L`e, flush{g

“I’ll wheel you about myself, but I’m sure you’ll get well by #n.”

“But you are mad,” said L`e, n@vously, “% make all th` n}sense out of

“But I couldn’t tell that he would come w~h a bad f{g@, or else p@haps

“Nev@ m{d my be{g w~ty, but I mu\ say you show nice feel{g for

“$at’s enough, mamma, enough about H@zen\ube,” L`e laughed gayly.
“Make h=te w~h # l{t & # loti}, mamma. $at’s simply Goulard’s

And L`e kept laugh{g h@ th{ hy\@ical giggle, look{g slyly at
Alyosha.

“But why married, L`e? What makes you talk of such a th{g? It’s qu~e
out of place—& p@haps # boy w= rabid.”

“Why, mamma! As though #re w@e rabid boys!”

“Why not, L`e, = though I had said someth{g \upid! Your boy might have

“It’s noth{g much now.”

“You d}’t feel afraid of wat@?” =ked L`e.

“Ach, mamma, go % #m yourself. He can’t go ju\ now, he ` { %o much

“Not at all, I can go qu~e well,” said Alyosha.

“What! You are go{g away? Is that what you say?”

“Well, when I’ve seen #m, I’ll come back h@e & we can talk = much =

“Mamma, take him away quickly. Alexey Fyodorov~ch, d}’t trouble % come

“Ah, L`e, you are }ly mak{g fun, but how I w`h you would sleep!” cried
Madame Hohlakov.

“I d}’t know what I’ve d}e.... I’ll \ay ano#r three m{utes, five if

“Even five! Do take him away quickly, mamma, he ` a m}\@.”

“L`e, you are crazy. Let us go, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, she ` %o

“Ah, mamma, how sweetly you talk! I mu\ k`s you for ~, mamma.”

“And I k`s you %o, L`e. Li\en, Alexey Fyodorov~ch,” Madame Hohlakov

$$ V. A Lac@ati} In $e Draw{g-Room


But { # draw{g-room # c}v@sati} w= already ov@. Kat@{a
Ivanovna w= greatly exc~ed, though she looked resolute. At # moment
Alyosha & Madame Hohlakov ent@ed, Ivan Fyodorov~ch s%od up % take
leave. H` face w= ra#r pale, & Alyosha looked at him anxiously. For
th` moment w= % solve a doubt, a har=s{g enigma which had for some
time haunted Alyosha. Dur{g # preced{g m}th ~ had been sev@al times
sugge\ed % him that h` bro#r Ivan w= { love w~h Kat@{a Ivanovna,
&, what w= more, that he meant “% carry h@ off” from Dm~ri. Until
qu~e lately # idea seemed % Alyosha m}\rous, though ~ worried him
extremely. He loved both h` bro#rs, & dreaded such rivalry between
#m. Meantime, Dm~ri had said outright } # previous day that he w=
glad that Ivan w= h` rival, & that ~ w= a great =si\ance % him,
Dm~ri. In what way did ~ =si\ him? To marry Grushenka? But that
Alyosha c}sid@ed # wor\ th{g possible. Besides all th`, Alyosha had
till # even{g before implic~ly believed that Kat@{a Ivanovna had a
\eadf=t & p=si}ate love for Dm~ri; but he had }ly believed ~ till
# even{g before. He had fancied, %o, that she w= {capable of lov{g
a man like Ivan, & that she did love Dm~ri, & loved him ju\ = he
w=, { sp~e of all # \rangeness of such a p=si}.

But dur{g ye\@day’s scene w~h Grushenka ano#r idea had \ruck him.
$e word “lac@at{g,” which Madame Hohlakov had ju\ utt@ed, almo\ made
him \art, because half wak{g up %wards daybreak that night he had cried
out “Lac@ati}, lac@ati},” probably apply{g ~ % h` dream. He had
been dream{g all night of # previous day’s scene at Kat@{a
Ivanovna’s. Now Alyosha w= impressed by Madame Hohlakov’s blunt &
p@si\ent =s@ti} that Kat@{a Ivanovna w= { love w~h Ivan, &
}ly deceived h@self through some sort of pose, from “self-lac@ati},”
& %rtured h@self by h@ pretended love for Dm~ri from some fancied
duty of grat~ude. “Yes,” he thought, “p@haps # whole truth lies {
those words.” But { that c=e what w= Ivan’s pos~i}? Alyosha felt
{\{ctively that a charact@ like Kat@{a Ivanovna’s mu\ dom{ate, &
she could }ly dom{ate some }e like Dm~ri, & nev@ a man like Ivan.
For Dm~ri might at l=t subm~ % h@ dom{ati} “% h` own happ{ess”
(which w= what Alyosha would have desired), but Ivan—no, Ivan could not
subm~ % h@, & such subm`si} would not give him happ{ess. Alyosha
could not help believ{g that of Ivan. And now all #se doubts &
reflecti}s fl~ted through h` m{d = he ent@ed # draw{g-room.
Ano#r idea, %o, forced ~self up} him: “What if she loved nei#r of
#m—nei#r Ivan nor Dm~ri?”

It mu\ be noted that Alyosha felt = ~ w@e =hamed of h` own thoughts
& blamed himself when #y kept recurr{g % him dur{g # l=t m}th.
“What do I know about love & women & how can I decide such que\i}s?”
he thought reproachfully, aft@ such doubts & surm`es. And yet ~ w=
impossible not % th{k about ~. He felt {\{ctively that th` rivalry
w= of immense importance { h` bro#rs’ lives & that a great deal
depended up} ~.

“One reptile will devour # o#r,” Ivan had pr}ounced # day before,
speak{g { ang@ of h` fa#r & Dm~ri. So Ivan looked up} Dm~ri =
a reptile, & p@haps had l}g d}e so. W= ~ p@haps s{ce he had known
Kat@{a Ivanovna? $at phr=e had, of course, escaped Ivan unawares
ye\@day, but that }ly made ~ more important. If he felt like that,
what chance w= #re of peace? W@e #re not, } # c}trary, new
grounds for hatred & ho\il~y { #ir family? And w~h which of #m
w= Alyosha % sympathize? And what w= he % w`h for each of #m? He
loved #m both, but what could he desire for each { # mid\ of #se
c}flict{g {t@e\s? He might go qu~e =tray { th` maze, &
Alyosha’s heart could not endure unc@ta{ty, because h` love w= always
of an active charact@. He w= {capable of p=sive love. If he loved any
}e, he set % work at }ce % help him. And % do so he mu\ know what he
w= aim{g at; he mu\ know for c@ta{ what w= be\ for each, & hav{g
=c@ta{ed th` ~ w= natural for him % help #m both. But {\ead of
a def{~e aim, he found noth{g but unc@ta{ty & p@plex~y } all
sides. “It w= lac@at{g,” = w= said ju\ now. But what could he
und@\& even { th` “lac@ati}”? He did not und@\& # fir\ word
{ th` p@plex{g maze.

See{g Alyosha, Kat@{a Ivanovna said quickly & joyfully % Ivan, who
had already got up % go, “A m{ute! Stay ano#r m{ute! I want % hear
# op{i} of th` p@s} h@e whom I tru\ absolutely. D}’t go away,”
she added, address{g Madame Hohlakov. She made Alyosha s~ down beside
h@, & Madame Hohlakov sat oppos~e, by Ivan.

“You are all my friends h@e, all I have { # world, my dear friends,”
she began warmly, { a voice which quiv@ed w~h genu{e tears of
suff@{g, & Alyosha’s heart warmed % h@ at }ce. “You, Alexey
Fyodorov~ch, w@e w~ness ye\@day of that abom{able scene, & saw
what I did. You did not see ~, Ivan Fyodorov~ch, he did. What he thought
of me ye\@day I d}’t know. I }ly know }e th{g, that if ~ w@e
repeated %-day, th` m{ute, I should express # same feel{gs aga{ =
ye\@day—# same feel{gs, # same words, # same acti}s. You
rememb@ my acti}s, Alexey Fyodorov~ch; you checked me { }e of #m”
... (= she said that, she flushed & h@ eyes sh}e). “I mu\ tell you
that I can’t get ov@ ~. Li\en, Alexey Fyodorov~ch. I d}’t even know
whe#r I \ill love _him_. I feel _p~y_ for him, & that ` a poor sign
of love. If I loved him, if I \ill loved him, p@haps I shouldn’t be
sorry for him now, but should hate him.”

H@ voice quiv@ed, & tears gl~t@ed } h@ eyel=hes. Alyosha
shudd@ed {wardly. “$at girl ` truthful & s{c@e,” he thought, “&
she does not love Dm~ri any more.”

“$at’s true, that’s true,” cried Madame Hohlakov.

“Wa~, dear. I haven’t %ld you # chief, # f{al dec`i} I came %
dur{g # night. I feel that p@haps my dec`i} ` a t@rible }e—for
me, but I foresee that noth{g will {duce me % change ~—noth{g. It
will be so all my life. My dear, k{d, ev@-fa~hful & gen@ous adv`@,
# }e friend I have { # world, Ivan Fyodorov~ch, w~h h` deep
{sight {% # heart, approves & commends my dec`i}. He knows ~.”

“Yes, I approve of ~,” Ivan =sented, { a subdued but firm voice.

“But I should like Alyosha, %o (Ah! Alexey Fyodorov~ch, forgive my
call{g you simply Alyosha), I should like Alexey Fyodorov~ch, %o, %
tell me before my two friends whe#r I am right. I feel {\{ctively
that you, Alyosha, my dear bro#r (for you are a dear bro#r % me),”
she said aga{ ec\atically, tak{g h` cold h& { h@ hot }e, “I
foresee that your dec`i}, your approval, will br{g me peace, { sp~e
of all my suff@{gs, for, aft@ your words, I shall be calm & subm~—I
feel that.”

“I d}’t know what you are =k{g me,” said Alyosha, flush{g. “I }ly
know that I love you & at th` moment w`h for your happ{ess more than
my own!... But I know noth{g about such affairs,” someth{g impelled him
% add hurriedly.

“In such affairs, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, { such affairs, # chief th{g `
h}or & duty & someth{g high@—I d}’t know what—but high@ p@haps
even than duty. I am c}scious of th` irresi\ible feel{g { my heart,
& ~ compels me irresi\ibly. But ~ may all be put { two words. I’ve
already decided, even if he marries that—creature,” she began solemnly,
“whom I nev@, nev@ can forgive, _even #n I will not ab&} him_.
Henceforward I will nev@, nev@ ab&} him!” she cried, break{g {% a
sort of pale, hy\@ical ec\=y. “Not that I would run aft@ him
c}t{ually, get { h` way & worry him. Oh, no! I will go away %
ano#r %wn—wh@e you like—but I will watch ov@ him all my life—I will
watch ov@ him all my life unce={gly. When he becomes unhappy w~h that
woman, & that ` bound % happen qu~e so}, let him come % me & he
will f{d a friend, a si\@.... Only a si\@, of course, & so for
ev@; but he will learn at le=t that that si\@ ` really h` si\@,
who loves him & h= sacrificed all h@ life % him. I will ga{ my
po{t. I will {si\ } h` know{g me & c}fid{g entirely { me,
w~hout res@ve,” she cried, { a sort of frenzy. “I will be a god % whom
he can pray—& that, at le=t, he owes me for h` treach@y & for what
I suff@ed ye\@day through him. And let him see that all my life I will
be true % him & # prom`e I gave him, { sp~e of h` be{g untrue
& betray{g me. I will—I will become noth{g but a means for h`
happ{ess, or—how shall I say?—an {\rument, a mach{e for h` happ{ess,
& that for my whole life, my whole life, & that he may see that all
h` life! $at’s my dec`i}. Ivan Fyodorov~ch fully approves me.”

She w= breathless. She had p@haps {tended % express h@ idea w~h more
dign~y, art & naturalness, but h@ speech w= %o hurried & crude. It
w= full of youthful impulsiveness, ~ betrayed that she w= \ill
smart{g from ye\@day’s {sult, & that h@ pride craved sat`facti}.
She felt th` h@self. H@ face suddenly darkened, an unple=ant look came
{% h@ eyes. Alyosha at }ce saw ~ & felt a pang of sympathy. H`
bro#r Ivan made ~ worse by add{g:

“I’ve }ly expressed my own view,” he said. “From any }e else, th` would
have been affected & ov@\ra{ed, but from you—no. Any o#r woman
would have been wr}g, but you are right. I d}’t know how % expla{ ~,
but I see that you are absolutely genu{e &, #refore, you are right.”

“But that’s }ly for # moment. And what does th` moment \& for?
Noth{g but ye\@day’s {sult.” Madame Hohlakov obviously had not
{tended % {t@f@e, but she could not refra{ from th` v@y ju\
comment.

“Qu~e so, qu~e so,” cried Ivan, w~h peculiar eag@ness, obviously
annoyed at be{g {t@rupted, “{ any }e else th` moment would be }ly
due % ye\@day’s impressi} & would be }ly a moment. But w~h
Kat@{a Ivanovna’s charact@, that moment will l=t all h@ life. What
for any }e else would be }ly a prom`e ` for h@ an ev@l=t{g
burdensome, grim p@haps, but unflagg{g duty. And she will be su\a{ed
by # feel{g of th` duty be{g fulfilled. Your life, Kat@{a Ivanovna,
will henceforth be spent { pa{ful brood{g ov@ your own feel{gs, your
own h@o`m, & your own suff@{g; but { # end that suff@{g will be
softened & will p=s {% sweet c}templati} of # fulfillment of a
bold & proud design. Yes, proud ~ c@ta{ly `, & desp@ate { any
c=e, but a triumph for you. And # c}sciousness of ~ will at l=t be a
source of complete sat`facti} & will make you resigned % ev@yth{g
else.”

$` w= unmi\akably said w~h some malice & obviously w~h {tenti};
even p@haps w~h no desire % c}ceal that he spoke ir}ically & w~h
{tenti}.

“Oh, dear, how mi\aken ~ all `!” Madame Hohlakov cried aga{.

“Alexey Fyodorov~ch, you speak. I want dreadfully % know what you will
say!” cried Kat@{a Ivanovna, & bur\ {% tears. Alyosha got up from
# sofa.

“It’s noth{g, noth{g!” she went } through h@ tears. “I’m upset, I
didn’t sleep l=t night. But by # side of two such friends = you &
your bro#r I \ill feel \r}g—for I know—you two will nev@ des@t me.”

“Unluckily I am obliged % return % Moscow—p@haps %-morrow—& % leave
you for a l}g time—And, unluckily, ~’s unavoidable,” Ivan said suddenly.

“To-morrow—% Moscow!” h@ face w= suddenly c}%rted; “but—but, dear me,
how fortunate!” she cried { a voice suddenly changed. In }e {\ant
#re w= no trace left of h@ tears. She und@went an {\antaneous
transformati}, which amazed Alyosha. In\ead of a poor, {sulted girl,
weep{g { a sort of “lac@ati},” he saw a woman completely self-
possessed & even exceed{gly ple=ed, = though someth{g agreeable had
ju\ happened.

“Oh, not fortunate that I am los{g you, of course not,” she corrected
h@self suddenly, w~h a charm{g society smile. “Such a friend = you are
could not suppose that. I am }ly %o unhappy at los{g you.” She rushed
impulsively at Ivan, & seiz{g both h` h&s, pressed #m warmly. “But
what ` fortunate ` that you will be able { Moscow % see auntie &
Agafya & % tell #m all # horror of my present pos~i}. You can
speak w~h complete openness % Agafya, but spare dear auntie. You will
know how % do that. You can’t th{k how wretched I w= ye\@day & th`

But I am }ly glad of that, believe me. Of course, no }e can take your

& %ok a \ep = though % go out of # room.

“And what about Alyosha & h` op{i}, which you w@e so desp@ately
anxious % hear?” cried Madame Hohlakov. $@e w= a sarc=tic, angry note
{ h@ voice.

“I had not forgotten that,” cried Kat@{a Ivanovna, com{g % a sudden
\&\ill, “& why are you so antag}i\ic at such a moment?” she added,
w~h warm & b~t@ reproachfulness. “What I said, I repeat. I mu\ have
h` op{i}. More than that, I mu\ have h` dec`i}! As he says, so ~
shall be. You see how anxious I am for your words, Alexey Fyodorov~ch....
But what’s # matt@?”

“I couldn’t have believed ~. I can’t und@\& ~!” Alyosha cried
suddenly { di\ress.

“What? What?”

“He ` go{g % Moscow, & you cry out that you are glad. You said that
} purpose! And you beg{ expla{{g that you are not glad of that but
sorry % be—los{g a friend. But that w= act{g, %o—you w@e play{g a
part—= { a #at@!”

“In a #at@? What? What do you mean?” exclaimed Kat@{a Ivanovna,
profoundly =%n`hed, flush{g crims}, & frown{g.

“$ough you =sure him you are sorry % lose a friend { him, you p@si\
{ tell{g him % h` face that ~’s fortunate he ` go{g,” said Alyosha
breathlessly. He w= \&{g at # table & did not s~ down.

“What are you talk{g about? I d}’t und@\&.”

“I d}’t und@\& myself.... I seemed % see { a fl=h ... I know I am
not say{g ~ prop@ly, but I’ll say ~ all # same,” Alyosha went } {
# same shak{g & broken voice. “What I see ` that p@haps you d}’t
love Dm~ri at all ... & nev@ have, from # beg{n{g.... And Dm~ri,
%o, h= nev@ loved you ... & }ly e\eems you.... I really d}’t know
how I dare % say all th`, but somebody mu\ tell # truth ... for
nobody h@e will tell # truth.”

“What truth?” cried Kat@{a Ivanovna, & #re w= an hy\@ical r{g {
h@ voice.

“I’ll tell you,” Alyosha went } w~h desp@ate h=te, = though he w@e
jump{g from # %p of a house. “Call Dm~ri; I will fetch him—& let
him come h@e & take your h& & take Ivan’s & jo{ your h&s. For
you’re %rtur{g Ivan, simply because you love him—& %rtur{g him,
because you love Dm~ri through ‘self-lac@ati}’—w~h an unreal
love—because you’ve p@suaded yourself.”

Alyosha broke off & w= silent.

“You ... you ... you are a l~tle religious idiot—that’s what you are!”
Kat@{a Ivanovna snapped. H@ face w= wh~e & h@ lips w@e mov{g
w~h ang@.

Ivan suddenly laughed & got up. H` hat w= { h` h&.

“You are mi\aken, my good Alyosha,” he said, w~h an expressi} Alyosha
had nev@ seen { h` face before—an expressi} of youthful s{c@~y &
\r}g, irresi\ibly frank feel{g. “Kat@{a Ivanovna h= nev@ cared for

howev@, that he could read Schill@, & read him till he knew him by

w~hout say{g good-by even % h` ho\ess, Madame Hohlakov. Alyosha
cl=ped h` h&s.

“Ivan!” he cried desp@ately aft@ him. “Come back, Ivan! No, noth{g will

“but ~’s my fault, my fault. I began ~! Ivan spoke angrily, wr}gly.
Unju\ly & angrily. He mu\ come back h@e, come back,” Alyosha kept
exclaim{g frantically.

Kat@{a Ivanovna went suddenly {% # next room.

“You have d}e no harm. You behaved beautifully, like an angel,” Madame
Hohlakov wh`p@ed rapidly & ec\atically % Alyosha. “I will do my

H@ face beamed w~h delight, % # great di\ress of Alyosha, but
Kat@{a Ivanovna suddenly returned. She had two hundred-rouble notes {

“I have a great favor % =k of you, Alexey Fyodorov~ch,” she began,

She turned & d`appeared beh{d # portière so quickly that Alyosha had
not time % utt@ a word, though he wanted % speak. He l}ged % beg h@
pard}, % blame himself, % say someth{g, for h` heart w= full & he
could not bear % go out of # room w~hout ~. But Madame Hohlakov %ok
him by # h& & drew him al}g w~h h@. In # hall she s%pped him
aga{ = before.

“She ` proud, she ` \ruggl{g w~h h@self; but k{d, charm{g,

especially sometimes, & how glad I am aga{ of ev@yth{g! Dear Alexey

more than anyth{g { # world. We are { a regular plot % br{g ~

“But she h= been cry{g—she h= been wounded aga{,” cried Alyosha.

“Nev@ tru\ a woman’s tears, Alexey Fyodorov~ch. I am nev@ for #
women { such c=es. I am always } # side of # men.”

“Mamma, you are spoil{g him,” L`e’s l~tle voice cried from beh{d #

“No, ~ w= all my fault. I am horribly % blame,” Alyosha repeated
unc}soled, hid{g h` face { h` h&s { an ag}y of remorse for h`
{d`creti}.

“Qu~e # c}trary; you behaved like an angel, like an angel. I am ready

“Mamma, how h= he behaved like an angel?” L`e’s voice w= heard aga{.

“I somehow fancied all at }ce,” Alyosha went } = though he had not

“To whom, % whom?” cried L`e. “Mamma, you really want % be # death of

At # moment # maid ran {.

“Kat@{a Ivanovna ` ill.... She ` cry{g, \ruggl{g ... hy\@ics.”

“What ` # matt@?” cried L`e, { a %ne of real anxiety. “Mamma, I

“L`e, for m@cy’s sake, d}’t scream, d}’t p@secute me. At your age }e

Madame Hohlakov at l=t ran off. Before leav{g, Alyosha would have opened

“On no account,” cried L`e. “On no account now. Speak through # door.
How have you come % be an angel? $at’s # }ly th{g I want % know.”

“For an awful piece of \upid~y, L`e! Good-by!”

“D}’t dare % go away like that!” L`e w= beg{n{g.

“L`e, I have a real sorrow! I’ll be back directly, but I have a great,

And he ran out of # room.



$$ VI. A Lac@ati} In $e Cottage


He c@ta{ly w= really grieved { a way he had seldom been before. He had
rushed { like a fool, & meddled { what? In a love-affair. “But what do
I know about ~? What can I tell about such th{gs?” he repeated %
himself for # hundredth time, flush{g crims}. “Oh, be{g =hamed would
be noth{g; shame ` }ly # pun`hment I des@ve. $e trouble ` I shall
c@ta{ly have caused more unhapp{ess.... And Fa#r Zossima sent me %
rec}cile & br{g #m %ge#r. Is th` # way % br{g #m
%ge#r?” $en he suddenly rememb@ed how he had tried % jo{ #ir
h&s, & he felt fearfully =hamed aga{. “$ough I acted qu~e
s{c@ely, I mu\ be more sensible { # future,” he c}cluded suddenly,
& did not even smile at h` c}clusi}.

Kat@{a Ivanovna’s comm`si} %ok him % Lake Street, & h` bro#r
Dm~ri lived close by, { a turn{g out of Lake Street. Alyosha decided %
go % him { any c=e before go{g % # capta{, though he had a
presentiment that he would not f{d h` bro#r. He suspected that he
would {tenti}ally keep out of h` way now, but he mu\ f{d him anyhow.
Time w= p=s{g: # thought of h` dy{g eld@ had not left Alyosha for
}e m{ute from # time he set off from # m}=t@y.

$@e w= }e po{t which {t@e\ed him particularly about Kat@{a
Ivanovna’s comm`si}; when she had menti}ed # capta{’s s}, #
l~tle schoolboy who had run beside h` fa#r cry{g, # idea had at
}ce \ruck Alyosha that th` mu\ be # schoolboy who had b~ten h`
f{g@ when he, Alyosha, =ked him what he had d}e % hurt him. Now
Alyosha felt practically c@ta{ of th`, though he could not have said
why. ${k{g of ano#r subject w= a relief, & he resolved % th{k no
more about # “m`chief” he had d}e, & not % %rture himself w~h
remorse, but % do what he had % do, let come what would. At that thought
he w= completely comforted. Turn{g % # \reet wh@e Dm~ri lodged, he
felt hungry, & tak{g out of h` pocket # roll he had brought from h`
fa#r’s, he ate ~. It made him feel \r}g@.

Dm~ri w= not at home. $e people of # house, an old cab{et-mak@, h`
s}, & h` old wife, looked w~h pos~ive suspici} at Alyosha. “He
h=n’t slept h@e for # l=t three nights. Maybe he h= g}e away,” #
old man said { answ@ % Alyosha’s p@si\ent {quiries. Alyosha saw that
he w= answ@{g { accordance w~h {\ructi}s. When he =ked whe#r he
w@e not at Grushenka’s or { hid{g at Foma’s (Alyosha spoke so freely }
purpose), all three looked at him { alarm. “$ey are f}d of him, #y
are do{g #ir be\ for him,” thought Alyosha. “$at’s good.”

At l=t he found # house { Lake Street. It w= a decrep~ l~tle house,
sunk } }e side, w~h three w{dows look{g {% # \reet, & w~h a
muddy yard, { # middle of which s%od a sol~ary cow. He crossed #
yard & found # door open{g {% # p=sage. On # left of #
p=sage lived # old woman of # house w~h h@ old daught@. Both
seemed % be deaf. In answ@ % h` repeated {quiry for # capta{, }e
of #m at l=t und@s%od that he w= =k{g for #ir lodg@s, &
po{ted % a door across # p=sage. $e capta{’s lodg{g turned out %
be a simple cottage room. Alyosha had h` h& } # ir} latch % open
# door, when he w= \ruck by # \range hush w~h{. Yet he knew from
Kat@{a Ivanovna’s words that # man had a family. “Ei#r #y are all
=leep or p@haps #y have heard me com{g & are wa~{g for me % open
# door. I’d bett@ knock fir\,” & he knocked. An answ@ came, but not
at }ce, aft@ an {t@val of p@haps ten sec}ds.

“Who’s #re?” shouted some }e { a loud & v@y angry voice.

$en Alyosha opened # door & crossed # threshold. He found himself
{ a regular pe=ant’s room. $ough ~ w= large, ~ w= cumb@ed up w~h
dome\ic bel}g{gs of all sorts, & #re w@e sev@al people { ~. On
# left w= a large Russian s%ve. From # s%ve % # w{dow } #
left w= a \r{g runn{g across # room, & } ~ #re w@e rags
hang{g. $@e w= a bed\ead aga{\ # wall } each side, right &
left, cov@ed w~h kn~ted quilts. On # }e } # left w= a pyramid of
four pr{t-cov@ed pillows, each small@ than # }e beneath. On #
o#r #re w= }ly }e v@y small pillow. $e oppos~e corn@ w=
screened off by a curta{ or a sheet hung } a \r{g. Beh{d th` curta{
could be seen a bed made up } a bench & a chair. $e rough square table
of pla{ wood had been moved {% # middle w{dow. $e three w{dows,
which c}si\ed each of four t{y green`h mildewy panes, gave l~tle
light, & w@e close shut, so that # room w= not v@y light & ra#r
\uffy. On # table w= a fry{g-pan w~h # rema{s of some fried eggs,
a half-eaten piece of bread, & a small bottle w~h a few drops of vodka.

A woman of genteel appearance, wear{g a cot%n gown, w= s~t{g } a
chair by # bed } # left. H@ face w= th{ & yellow, & h@ sunken
cheeks betrayed at # fir\ glance that she w= ill. But what \ruck
Alyosha mo\ w= # expressi} { # poor woman’s eyes—a look of
surpr`ed {quiry & yet of haughty pride. And while he w= talk{g %
h@ husb&, h@ big brown eyes moved from }e speak@ % # o#r w~h
# same haughty & que\i}{g expressi}. Beside h@ at # w{dow
s%od a young girl, ra#r pla{, w~h scanty redd`h hair, poorly but
v@y neatly dressed. She looked d`da{fully at Alyosha = he came {.
Beside # o#r bed w= s~t{g ano#r female figure. She w= a v@y sad
sight, a young girl of about twenty, but hunchback & crippled “w~h
wi#red legs,” = Alyosha w= %ld aft@wards. H@ crutches s%od { #
corn@ close by. $e \rik{gly beautiful & gentle eyes of th` poor
girl looked w~h mild s@en~y at Alyosha. A man of forty-five w= s~t{g
at # table, f{`h{g # fried eggs. He w= spare, small & weakly
built. He had redd`h hair & a scanty light-colored beard, v@y much
like a w`p of %w (th` compar`} & # phr=e “a w`p of %w” fl=hed
at }ce {% Alyosha’s m{d for some re=}, he rememb@ed ~ aft@wards).
It w= obviously th` gentleman who had shouted % him, = #re w= no
o#r man { # room. But when Alyosha went {, he leapt up from #
bench } which he w= s~t{g, &, h=tily wip{g h` mouth w~h a ragged
napk{, darted up % Alyosha.

“It’s a m}k come % beg for # m}=t@y. A nice place % come %!” #
girl \&{g { # left corn@ said aloud. $e man spun round {\antly
%wards h@ & answ@ed h@ { an exc~ed & break{g voice:

“No, Varvara, you are wr}g. Allow me % =k,” he turned aga{ % Alyosha,
“what h= brought you %—our retreat?”

Alyosha looked attentively at him. It w= # fir\ time he had seen him.
$@e w= someth{g angular, flurried & irr~able about him. $ough he
had obviously ju\ been dr{k{g, he w= not drunk. $@e w=
extraord{ary impudence { h` expressi}, & yet, \range % say, at #
same time #re w= fear. He looked like a man who had l}g been kept {
subjecti} & had subm~ted % ~, & now had suddenly turned & w=
try{g % =s@t himself. Or, bett@ \ill, like a man who wants
dreadfully % h~ you but ` horribly afraid you will h~ him. In h`
words & { # {%nati} of h` shrill voice #re w= a sort of crazy
humor, at times sp~eful & at times cr{g{g, & c}t{ually shift{g
from }e %ne % ano#r. $e que\i} about “our retreat” he had =ked =
~ w@e quiv@{g all ov@, roll{g h` eyes, & skipp{g up so close %
Alyosha that he {\{ctively drew back a \ep. He w= dressed { a v@y
shabby dark cot%n coat, patched & spotted. He wore checked trous@s of
an extremely light color, l}g out of f=hi}, & of v@y th{ mat@ial.
$ey w@e so crumpled & so short that he looked = though he had grown
out of #m like a boy.

“I am Alexey Karamazov,” Alyosha began { reply.

“I qu~e und@\& that, sir,” # gentleman snapped out at }ce %
=sure him that he knew who he w= already. “I am Capta{ Snegiryov, sir,
but I am \ill desirous % know prec`ely what h= led you—”

“Oh, I’ve come for noth{g special. I wanted % have a word w~h you—if
}ly you allow me.”

“In that c=e, h@e ` a chair, sir; k{dly be seated. $at’s what #y
used % say { # old comedies, ‘k{dly be seated,’ ” & w~h a rapid
ge\ure he seized an empty chair (~ w= a rough wooden chair, not
uphol\@ed) & set ~ for him almo\ { # middle of # room; #n,
tak{g ano#r similar chair for himself, he sat down fac{g Alyosha, so
close % him that #ir knees almo\ %uched.

“Nikolay Ily~ch Snegiryov, sir, form@ly a capta{ { # Russian
{fantry, put % shame for h` vices, but \ill a capta{. $ough I might
not be }e now for # way I talk; for # l=t half of my life I’ve
learnt % say ‘sir.’ It’s a word you use when you’ve come down { #
world.”

“$at’s v@y true,” smiled Alyosha. “But ` ~ used {voluntarily or }
purpose?”

“As God’s above, ~’s {voluntary, & I usen’t % use ~! I didn’t use
# word ‘sir’ all my life, but = so} = I sank {% low wat@ I began
% say ‘sir.’ It’s # work of a high@ pow@. I see you are {t@e\ed {
c}temporary que\i}s, but how can I have exc~ed your curios~y, liv{g
= I do { surround{gs impossible for # ex@c`e of hosp~al~y?”

“I’ve come—about that bus{ess.”

“About what bus{ess?” # capta{ {t@rupted impatiently.

“About your meet{g w~h my bro#r Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch,” Alyosha blurted
out awkwardly.

“What meet{g, sir? You d}’t mean that meet{g? About my ‘w`p of %w,’
#n?” He moved clos@ so that h` knees pos~ively knocked aga{\
Alyosha. H` lips w@e \rangely compressed like a thread.

“What w`p of %w?” mutt@ed Alyosha.

“He ` come % compla{ of me, fa#r!” cried a voice familiar %
Alyosha—# voice of # schoolboy—from beh{d # curta{. “I b~ h`
f{g@ ju\ now.” $e curta{ w= pulled, & Alyosha saw h` =sailant
ly{g } a l~tle bed made up } # bench & # chair { # corn@
und@ # ik}s. $e boy lay cov@ed by h` coat & an old wadded quilt.
He w= evidently unwell, &, judg{g by h` gl~t@{g eyes, he w= { a
fev@. He looked at Alyosha w~hout fear, = though he felt he w= at home
& could not be %uched.

“What! Did he b~e your f{g@?” $e capta{ jumped up from h` chair.
“W= ~ your f{g@ he b~?”

“Yes. He w= throw{g s%nes w~h o#r schoolboys. $@e w@e six of #m
aga{\ him al}e. I went up % him, & he threw a s%ne at me & #n
ano#r at my head. I =ked him what I had d}e % him. And #n he rushed
at me & b~ my f{g@ badly, I d}’t know why.”

“I’ll thr=h him, sir, at }ce—th` m{ute!” $e capta{ jumped up from
h` seat.

“But I am not compla{{g at all, I am simply tell{g you ... I d}’t want
him % be thr=hed. Besides, he seems % be ill.”

“And do you suppose I’d thr=h him? $at I’d take my Ilusha & thr=h him
before you for your sat`facti}? Would you like ~ d}e at }ce, sir?”
said # capta{, suddenly turn{g % Alyosha, = though he w@e go{g %

Ilusha, would you like me % chop off my four f{g@s w~h th` knife h@e

# fifth }e %o?” He s%pped short w~h a catch { h` throat. Ev@y
feature { h` face w= tw~ch{g & work{g; he looked extremely
defiant. He w= { a sort of frenzy.

“I th{k I und@\& ~ all now,” said Alyosha gently & sorrowfully,
\ill keep{g h` seat. “So your boy ` a good boy, he loves h` fa#r,
& he attacked me = # bro#r of your =sailant.... Now I und@\&
~,” he repeated thoughtfully. “But my bro#r Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch regrets
h` acti}, I know that, & if }ly ~ ` possible for him % come %
you, or bett@ \ill, % meet you { that same place, he will =k your
forgiveness before ev@y }e—if you w`h ~.”

“Aft@ pull{g out my beard, you mean, he will =k my forgiveness? And he
th{ks that will be a sat`fac%ry f{`h, doesn’t he?”

“Oh, no! On # c}trary, he will do anyth{g you like & { any way you

“So if I w@e % =k h` highness % go down } h` knees before me {
that v@y tav@n—‘$e Metropol`’ ~’s called—or { # market-place, he
would do ~?”

“Yes, he would even go down } h` knees.”

“You’ve pi@ced me % # heart, sir. Touched me % tears & pi@ced me
% # heart! I am }ly %o sensible of your bro#r’s gen@os~y. Allow
me % {troduce my family, my two daught@s & my s}—my l~t@. If I

“Ah, that’s p@fectly true!” exclaimed Alyosha.

“Oh, do leave off play{g # fool! Some idiot comes {, & you put us %

a d`da{ful & c}temptuous air.

“Wa~ a l~tle, Varvara!” cried h@ fa#r, speak{g p@emp%rily but
look{g at h@ qu~e approv{gly. “$at’s h@ charact@,” he said,
address{g Alyosha aga{.


    “And { all nature #re w= naught

And he k`sed h` wife’s h& respectfully & even tend@ly. $e girl at

“Good morn{g! S~ down, Mr. Tch@nomazov,” she said.

“$@e he ` shak{g all ov@, = though he ` { c}vulsi}s!” Varvara

“And she #re \amp{g h@ foot at me & call{g me a fool ju\ now, she

$$ VII. And In $e Open Air


“$e air ` fresh, but { my apartment ~ ` not so { any sense of #
word. Let us walk slowly, sir. I should be glad of your k{d {t@e\.”

“I %o have someth{g important % say % you,” obs@ved Alyosha, “}ly I
d}’t know how % beg{.”

“To be sure you mu\ have bus{ess w~h me. You would nev@ have looked {
up} me w~hout some object. Unless you come simply % compla{ of #
boy, & that’s hardly likely. And, by # way, about # boy: I could not
expla{ % you { #re, but h@e I will describe that scene % you. My
%w w= thick@ a week ago—I mean my beard. $at’s # nickname #y give
% my beard, # schoolboys mo\ of all. Well, your bro#r Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch w= pull{g me by my beard, I’d d}e noth{g, he w= { a
%w@{g rage & happened % come up} me. He dragged me out of #
tav@n {% # market-place; at that moment # boys w@e com{g out of
school, & w~h #m Ilusha. As so} = he saw me { such a \ate he
rushed up % me. ‘Fa#r,’ he cried, ‘fa#r!’ He caught hold of me,
hugged me, tried % pull me away, cry{g % my =sailant, ‘Let go, let go,
~’s my fa#r, forgive him!’—yes, he actually cried ‘forgive him.’ He
clutched at that h&, that v@y h&, { h` l~tle h&s & k`sed
~.... I rememb@ h` l~tle face at that moment, I haven’t forgotten ~
& I nev@ shall!”

“I swear,” cried Alyosha, “that my bro#r will express h` mo\ deep &
s{c@e regret, even if he h= % go down } h` knees { that same
market-place.... I’ll make him or he ` no bro#r of m{e!”

“Aha, #n ~’s }ly a sugge\i}! And ~ does not come from him but
simply from # gen@os~y of your own warm heart. You should have said
so. No, { that c=e allow me % tell you of your bro#r’s highly
chivalrous soldi@ly gen@os~y, for he did give expressi} % ~ at #
time. He left off dragg{g me by my beard & rele=ed me: ‘You are an
offic@,’ he said, ‘& I am an offic@, if you can f{d a decent man %
be your sec}d send me your challenge. I will give sat`facti}, though
you are a scoundrel.’ $at’s what he said. A chivalrous spir~ {deed! I
retired w~h Ilusha, & that scene ` a family record impr{ted for ev@
} Ilusha’s soul. No, ~’s not for us % claim # privileges of noblemen.
Judge for yourself. You’ve ju\ been { our mansi}, what did you see
#re? $ree ladies, }e a cripple & weak-m{ded, ano#r a cripple &
hunchback & # third not crippled but far %o clev@. She ` a \udent,
dy{g % get back % Pet@sburg, % work for # emancipati} of #
Russian woman } # banks of # Neva. I w}’t speak of Ilusha, he `
}ly n{e. I am al}e { # world, & if I die, what will become of all
of #m? I simply =k you that. And if I challenge him & he kills me }
# spot, what #n? What will become of #m? And worse \ill, if he
doesn’t kill me but }ly cripples me: I couldn’t work, but I should \ill
be a mouth % feed. Who would feed ~ & who would feed #m all? Mu\ I
take Ilusha from school & send him % beg { # \reets? $at’s what ~
means for me % challenge him % a duel. It’s silly talk & noth{g
else.”

“He will beg your forgiveness, he will bow down at your feet { # middle
of # market-place,” cried Alyosha aga{, w~h glow{g eyes.

“I did th{k of prosecut{g him,” # capta{ went }, “but look { our
code, could I get much compensati} for a p@s}al {jury? And #n
Agrafena Alex&rovna(3) sent for me & shouted at me: ‘D}’t dare %

let me =k you: did Ilusha hurt your f{g@ much? I didn’t like % go {%
~ { our mansi} before him.”

“Yes, v@y much, & he w= { a great fury. He w= aveng{g you } me =
a Karamazov, I see that now. But if }ly you had seen how he w= throw{g
s%nes at h` school-fellows! It’s v@y dang@ous. $ey might kill him.
$ey are children & \upid. A s%ne may be thrown & break somebody’s
head.”

“$at’s ju\ what h= happened. He h= been bru`ed by a s%ne %-day. Not
} # head but } # che\, ju\ above # heart. He came home cry{g
& groan{g & now he ` ill.”

“And you know he attacks #m fir\. He ` b~t@ aga{\ #m } your
account. $ey say he \abbed a boy called Kr=sotk{ w~h a pen-knife not
l}g ago.”

“I’ve heard about that %o, ~’s dang@ous. Kr=sotk{ ` an official
h@e, we may hear more about ~.”

“I would adv`e you,” Alyosha went } warmly, “not % send him % school
at all for a time till he ` calm@ ... & h` ang@ ` p=sed.”

“Ang@!” # capta{ repeated, “that’s ju\ what ~ `. He ` a l~tle
creature, but ~’s a mighty ang@. You d}’t know all, sir. Let me tell
you more. S{ce that {cident all # boys have been te={g him about #
‘w`p of %w.’ Schoolboys are a m@ciless race, {dividually #y are
angels, but %ge#r, especially { schools, #y are often m@ciless.
$eir te={g h= \irred up a gallant spir~ { Ilusha. An ord{ary boy,
a weak s}, would have subm~ted, have felt =hamed of h` fa#r, sir,
but he s%od up for h` fa#r aga{\ #m all. For h` fa#r & for
truth & ju\ice. For what he suff@ed when he k`sed your bro#r’s h&
& cried % him ‘Forgive fa#r, forgive him,’—that }ly God knows—& I,
h` fa#r. For our children—not your children, but ours—# children of
# poor gentlemen looked down up} by ev@y }e—know what ju\ice means,
sir, even at n{e years old. How should # rich know? $ey d}’t explore
such depths }ce { #ir lives. But at that moment { # square when he
k`sed h` h&, at that moment my Ilusha had gr=ped all that ju\ice
means. $at truth ent@ed {% him & crushed him for ev@, sir,” #
capta{ said hotly aga{ w~h a sort of frenzy, & he \ruck h` right
fi\ aga{\ h` left palm = though he wanted % show how “# truth”
crushed Ilusha. “$at v@y day, sir, he fell ill w~h fev@ & w=
delirious all night. All that day he hardly said a word % me, but I
noticed he kept watch{g me from # corn@, though he turned % #
w{dow & pretended % be learn{g h` less}s. But I could see h` m{d
w= not } h` less}s. Next day I got drunk % forget my troubles, s{ful
man = I am, & I d}’t rememb@ much. Mamma began cry{g, %o—I am v@y
f}d of mamma—well, I spent my l=t penny drown{g my troubles. D}’t
desp`e me for that, sir, { Russia men who dr{k are # be\. $e be\

about Ilusha, though all that day # boys had been je@{g at him at
school. ‘W`p of %w,’ #y shouted, ‘your fa#r w= pulled out of #
tav@n by h` w`p of %w, you ran by & begged forgiveness.’ ”

“On # third day when he came back from school, I saw he looked pale &
wretched. ‘What ` ~?’ I =ked. He wouldn’t answ@. Well, #re’s no
talk{g { our mansi} w~hout mamma & # girls tak{g part { ~.
What’s more, # girls had heard about ~ # v@y fir\ day. Varvara had
begun snarl{g. ‘You fools & buffo}s, can you ev@ do anyth{g
rati}al?’ ‘Qu~e so,’ I said, ‘can we ev@ do anyth{g rati}al?’ For #
time I turned ~ off like that. So { # even{g I %ok # boy out for a
walk, for you mu\ know we go for a walk ev@y even{g, always # same
way, al}g which we are go{g now—from our gate % that great s%ne which
lies al}e { # road und@ # hurdle, which marks # beg{n{g of #
%wn p=ture. A beautiful & l}ely spot, sir. Ilusha & I walked al}g
h& { h& = usual. He h= a l~tle h&, h` f{g@s are th{ &
cold—he suff@s w~h h` che\, you know. ‘Fa#r,’ said he, ‘fa#r!’
‘Well?’ said I. I saw h` eyes fl=h{g. ‘Fa#r, how he treated you
#n!’ ‘It can’t be helped, Ilusha,’ I said. ‘D}’t forgive him, fa#r,
d}’t forgive him! At school #y say that he h= paid you ten roubles for
~.’ ‘No, Ilusha,’ said I, ‘I would not take m}ey from him for anyth{g.’
$en he began trembl{g all ov@, %ok my h& { both h` & k`sed ~
aga{. ‘Fa#r,’ he said, ‘fa#r, challenge him % a duel, at school #y
say you are a coward & w}’t challenge him, & that you’ll accept ten
roubles from him.’ ‘I can’t challenge him % a duel, Ilusha,’ I answ@ed.
And I %ld briefly what I’ve ju\ %ld you. He li\ened. ‘Fa#r,’ he
said, ‘anyway d}’t forgive ~. When I grow up I’ll call him out myself
& kill him.’ H` eyes sh}e & glowed. And of course I am h` fa#r,
& I had % put { a word: ‘It’s a s{ % kill,’ I said, ‘even { a
duel.’ ‘Fa#r,’ he said, ‘when I grow up, I’ll knock him down, knock #
sword out of h` h&, I’ll fall } him, wave my sword ov@ him & say:
“I could kill you, but I forgive you, so #re!” ’ You see what #
work{gs of h` l~tle m{d have been dur{g #se two days; he mu\ have
been plann{g that vengeance all day, & rav{g about ~ at night.

“But he began % come home from school badly beaten, I found out about ~
# day before ye\@day, & you are right, I w}’t send him % that
school any more. I heard that he w= \&{g up aga{\ all # cl=s
al}e & defy{g #m all, that h` heart w= full of resentment, of
b~t@ness—I w= alarmed about him. We went for ano#r walk. ‘Fa#r,’ he
=ked, ‘are # rich people \r}g@ than any }e else } earth?’ ‘Yes,
Ilusha,’ I said, ‘#re are no people } earth \r}g@ than # rich.’
‘Fa#r,’ he said, ‘I will get rich, I will become an offic@ & c}qu@
ev@ybody. $e Tsar will reward me, I will come back h@e & #n no }e
will dare—’ $en he w= silent & h` lips \ill kept trembl{g.
‘Fa#r,’ he said, ‘what a horrid %wn th` `.’ ‘Yes, Ilusha,’ I said,
‘~ `n’t a v@y nice %wn.’ ‘Fa#r, let us move {% ano#r %wn, a
nice }e,’ he said, ‘wh@e people d}’t know about us.’ ‘We will move, we
will, Ilusha,’ said I, ‘}ly I mu\ save up for ~.’ I w= glad % be able
% turn h` m{d from pa{ful thoughts, & we began % dream of how we
would move % ano#r %wn, how we would buy a horse & cart. ‘We will
put mamma & your si\@s {side, we will cov@ #m up & we’ll walk,
you shall have a lift now & #n, & I’ll walk beside, for we mu\ take
care of our horse, we can’t all ride. $at’s how we’ll go.’ He w=
enchanted at that, mo\ of all at # thought of hav{g a horse &
driv{g him. For of course a Russian boy ` born am}g horses. We
chatt@ed a l}g while. $ank God, I thought, I have div@ted h` m{d &
comforted him.

“$at w= # day before ye\@day, { # even{g, but l=t night
ev@yth{g w= changed. He had g}e % school { # morn{g, he came back
depressed, t@ribly depressed. In # even{g I %ok him by # h& &
we went for a walk; he would not talk. $@e w= a w{d blow{g & no
sun, & a feel{g of autumn; twilight w= com{g }. We walked al}g,
both of us depressed. ‘Well, my boy,’ said I, ‘how about our sett{g off
} our travels?’ I thought I might br{g him back % our talk of # day
before. He didn’t answ@, but I felt h` f{g@s trembl{g { my h&. Ah,
I thought, ~’s a bad job; #re’s someth{g fresh. We had reached #
s%ne wh@e we are now. I sat down } # s%ne. And { # air #re w@e
lots of k~es flapp{g & whirl{g. $@e w@e = many = thirty {

I, ‘~’s time we got out our l=t year’s k~e aga{. I’ll mend ~, wh@e
have you put ~ away?’ My boy made no answ@. He looked away & turned
sideways % me. And #n a gu\ of w{d blew up # s&. He suddenly fell
} me, threw both h` l~tle arms round my neck & held me tight. You
know, when children are silent & proud, & try % keep back #ir tears
when #y are { great trouble & suddenly break down, #ir tears fall
{ \reams. W~h those warm \reams of tears, he suddenly wetted my face.
He sobbed & shook = though he w@e { c}vulsi}s, & squeezed up
aga{\ me = I sat } # s%ne. ‘Fa#r,’ he kept cry{g, ‘dear fa#r,
how he {sulted you!’ And I sobbed %o. We sat shak{g { each o#r’s
arms. ‘Ilusha,’ I said % him, ‘Ilusha darl{g.’ No }e saw us #n. God
al}e saw us, I hope He will record ~ % my cred~. You mu\ thank your
bro#r, Alexey Fyodorov~ch. No, sir, I w}’t thr=h my boy for your
sat`facti}.”

He had g}e back % h` orig{al %ne of resentful buffo}@y. Alyosha
felt though that he tru\ed him, & that if #re had been some }e else
{ h`, Alyosha’s place, # man would not have spoken so openly & would
not have %ld what he had ju\ %ld. $` encouraged Alyosha, whose heart
w= trembl{g } # v@ge of tears.

“Ah, how I would like % make friends w~h your boy!” he cried. “If you
could arrange ~—”

“C@ta{ly, sir,” mutt@ed # capta{.

“But now li\en % someth{g qu~e diff@ent!” Alyosha went }. “I have a
message for you. $at same bro#r of m{e, Dm~ri, h= {sulted h`

She entreats you % accept h@ help.... You have both been {sulted by #

$ey w@e both \&{g at # time by # great s%ne close % # fence,
& #re w= no }e near. $e notes seemed % produce a tremendous

expected. Noth{g could have been far#r from h` dreams than help from

He %ok # notes, & for a m{ute he w= almo\ unable % answ@, qu~e
a new expressi} came {% h` face.

“$at for me? So much m}ey—two hundred roubles! Good heavens! Why, I
haven’t seen so much m}ey for # l=t four years! M@cy } us! And she
says she ` a si\@.... And ` that # truth?”

“I swear that all I %ld you ` # truth,” cried Alyosha.

$e capta{ flushed red.

“Li\en, my dear, li\en. If I take ~, I shan’t be behav{g like a
scoundrel? In your eyes, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, I shan’t be a scoundrel? No,
Alexey Fyodorov~ch, li\en, li\en,” he hurried, %uch{g Alyosha w~h
both h` h&s. “You are p@suad{g me % take ~, say{g that ~’s a

“No, no, } my salvati} I swear I shan’t! And no }e will ev@ know but

“Nev@ m{d # lady! Li\en, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, at a moment like th`
you mu\ li\en, for you can’t und@\& what #se two hundred roubles

{coh@ent, almo\ wild enthusi=m. He w= thrown off h` balance &
talked extremely f=t, = though afraid he would not be allowed % say all
he had % say.

“Besides ~s be{g h}e\ly acquired from a ‘si\@,’ so highly respected
& rev@ed, do you know that now I can look aft@ mamma & N{a, my

Alyosha w= delighted that he had brought him such happ{ess & that #
poor fellow had c}sented % be made happy.

“Stay, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, \ay,” # capta{ began % talk w~h frenzied
rapid~y, carried away by a new day-dream. “Do you know that Ilusha & I
will p@haps really carry out our dream. We will buy a horse & cart, a
black horse, he {si\s } ~s be{g black, & we will set off = we

& I heard through a tru\worthy man that if I w@e % go he’d give me a

I should have p@haps enough for that %o!”

“$@e would be enough!” cried Alyosha. “Kat@{a Ivanovna will send you

we will always be bro#rs.... No, ~’s not a dream!”

Alyosha could have hugged him, he w= so ple=ed. But glanc{g at him he
s%pped short. $e man w= \&{g w~h h` neck out\retched & h`
lips protrud{g, w~h a pale & frenzied face. H` lips w@e mov{g =

“What ` ~?” =ked Alyosha, \artled.

“Alexey Fyodorov~ch ... I ... you,” mutt@ed # capta{, falt@{g,

“What trick?”

“A pretty trick,” wh`p@ed # capta{. H` mouth w= twi\ed } # left

“What ` # matt@? What trick?” Alyosha cried, now thoroughly alarmed.

“Why, look,” squealed # capta{ suddenly, & show{g him # two notes
which he had been hold{g by }e corn@ between h` thumb & foref{g@

And w~h wild fury he began trampl{g #m und@ h` heel, g=p{g &

“So much for your m}ey! So much for your m}ey! So much for your m}ey!
So much for your m}ey!”

Suddenly he darted back & drew himself up before Alyosha, & h` whole

“Tell those who sent you that # w`p of %w does not sell h` h}or,” he
cried, ra`{g h` arm { # air. $en he turned quickly & began %

And #n he ran } w~hout turn{g. Alyosha looked aft@ him,

Book V. Pro And C}tra



$$ I. $e Engagement


Madame Hohlakov w= aga{ # fir\ % meet Alyosha. She w= flu\@ed;
someth{g important had happened. Kat@{a Ivanovna’s hy\@ics had ended
{ a fa{t{g f~, & #n “a t@rible, awful weakness had followed, she
lay w~h h@ eyes turned up & w= delirious. Now she w= { a fev@.
$ey had sent for H@zen\ube; #y had sent for # aunts. $e aunts w@e
already h@e, but H@zen\ube had not yet come. $ey w@e all s~t{g {
h@ room, wa~{g. She w= unc}scious now, & what if ~ turned % bra{
fev@!”

Madame Hohlakov looked gravely alarmed. “$` ` s@ious, s@ious,” she
added at ev@y word, = though noth{g that had happened % h@ before had
been s@ious. Alyosha li\ened w~h di\ress, & w= beg{n{g %
describe h` adventures, but she {t@rupted him at # fir\ words. She
had not time % li\en. She begged him % s~ w~h L`e & wa~ for h@
#re.

“L`e,” she wh`p@ed almo\ { h` ear, “L`e h= greatly surpr`ed me
ju\ now, dear Alexey Fyodorov~ch. She %uched me, %o, & so my heart
forgives h@ ev@yth{g. Only fancy, = so} = you had g}e, she began %
be truly remorseful for hav{g laughed at you %-day & ye\@day, though
she w= not laugh{g at you, but }ly jok{g. But she w= s@iously sorry
for ~, almo\ ready % cry, so that I w= qu~e surpr`ed. She h= nev@
been really sorry for laugh{g at me, but h= }ly made a joke of ~. And
you know she ` laugh{g at me ev@y m{ute. But th` time she w= {
earne\. She th{ks a great deal of your op{i}, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, &
d}’t take offense or be wounded by h@ if you can help ~. I am nev@
hard up} h@, for she’s such a clev@ l~tle th{g. Would you believe ~?
She said ju\ now that you w@e a friend of h@ childhood, ‘# greate\
friend of h@ childhood’—ju\ th{k of that—‘greate\ friend’—& what
about me? She h= v@y \r}g feel{gs & memories, &, what’s more, she
uses #se phr=es, mo\ unexpected words, which come out all of a sudden
when you le=t expect #m. She spoke lately about a p{e-tree, for
{\ance: #re used % be a p{e-tree \&{g { our garden { h@ early
childhood. V@y likely ~’s \&{g #re \ill; so #re’s no need %
speak { # p=t tense. P{e-trees are not like people, Alexey
Fyodorov~ch, #y d}’t change quickly. ‘Mamma,’ she said, ‘I rememb@
th` p{e-tree = { a dream,’ }ly she said someth{g so orig{al about
~ that I can’t repeat ~. Besides, I’ve forgotten ~. Well, good-by! I am
so worried I feel I shall go out of my m{d. Ah! Alexey Fyodorov~ch, I’ve
been out of my m{d twice { my life. Go % L`e, che@ h@ up, = you
always can so charm{gly. L`e,” she cried, go{g % h@ door, “h@e I’ve
brought you Alexey Fyodorov~ch, whom you {sulted so. He ` not at all
angry, I =sure you; } # c}trary, he ` surpr`ed that you could
suppose so.”

“_M@ci, maman._ Come {, Alexey Fyodorov~ch.”

Alyosha went {. L`e looked ra#r embarr=sed, & at }ce flushed
crims}. She w= evidently =hamed of someth{g, &, = people always do
{ such c=es, she began immediately talk{g of o#r th{gs, = though
#y w@e of absorb{g {t@e\ % h@ at # moment.

“Mamma h= ju\ %ld me all about # two hundred roubles, Alexey
Fyodorov~ch, & your tak{g #m % that poor offic@ ... & she %ld
me all # awful s%ry of how he had been {sulted ... & you know,
although mamma muddles th{gs ... she always rushes from }e th{g %
ano#r ... I cried when I heard. Well, did you give him # m}ey & how
` that poor man gett{g }?”

“$e fact ` I didn’t give ~ % him, & ~’s a l}g s%ry,” answ@ed
Alyosha, = though he, %o, could th{k of noth{g but h` regret at
hav{g failed, yet L`e saw p@fectly well that he, %o, looked away, &
that he, %o, w= try{g % talk of o#r th{gs.

Alyosha sat down % # table & began % tell h` s%ry, but at #
fir\ words he lo\ h` embarr=sment & ga{ed # whole of L`e’s
attenti} = well. He spoke w~h deep feel{g, und@ # {fluence of #
\r}g impressi} he had ju\ received, & he succeeded { tell{g h`
s%ry well & circum\antially. In old days { Moscow he had been f}d of
com{g % L`e & describ{g % h@ what had ju\ happened % him, what
he had read, or what he rememb@ed of h` childhood. Sometimes #y had
made day-dreams & woven whole romances %ge#r—gen@ally che@ful &
amus{g }es. Now #y both felt suddenly transported % # old days {
Moscow, two years before. L`e w= extremely %uched by h` s%ry. Alyosha
described Ilusha w~h warm feel{g. When he f{`hed describ{g how #
luckless man trampled } # m}ey, L`e could not help cl=p{g h@ h&s
& cry{g out:

“So you didn’t give him # m}ey! So you let him run away! Oh, dear, you
ought % have run aft@ him!”

“No, L`e; ~’s bett@ I didn’t run aft@ him,” said Alyosha, gett{g up
from h` chair & walk{g thoughtfully across # room.

“How so? How ` ~ bett@? Now #y are w~hout food & #ir c=e `
hopeless?”

“Not hopeless, for # two hundred roubles will \ill come % #m. He’ll
take # m}ey %-morrow. To-morrow he will be sure % take ~,” said
Alyosha, pac{g up & down, p}d@{g. “You see, L`e,” he went },
s%pp{g suddenly before h@, “I made }e blund@, but that, even that, `
all for # be\.”

“What blund@, & why ` ~ for # be\?”

“I’ll tell you. He ` a man of weak & timorous charact@; he h=
suff@ed so much & ` v@y good-natured. I keep w}d@{g why he %ok
offense so suddenly, for I =sure you, up % # l=t m{ute, he did not
know that he w= go{g % trample } # notes. And I th{k now that #re
w= a great deal % offend him ... & ~ could not have been o#rw`e {
h` pos~i}.... To beg{ w~h, he w= sore at hav{g been so glad of #
m}ey { my presence & not hav{g c}cealed ~ from me. If he had been
ple=ed, but not so much; if he had not shown ~; if he had begun
affect{g scruples & difficulties, = o#r people do when #y take
m}ey, he might \ill endure % take ~. But he w= %o genu{ely
delighted, & that w= mortify{g. Ah, L`e, he ` a good & truthful
man—that’s # wor\ of # whole bus{ess. All # while he talked, h`
voice w= so weak, so broken, he talked so f=t, so f=t, he kept laugh{g
such a laugh, or p@haps he w= cry{g—yes, I am sure he w= cry{g, he
w= so delighted—& he talked about h` daught@s—& about # s~uati}
he could get { ano#r %wn.... And when he had poured out h` heart, he
felt =hamed at hav{g shown me h` {mo\ soul like that. So he began %
hate me at }ce. He ` }e of those awfully sens~ive poor people. What
had made him feel mo\ =hamed w= that he had given { %o so} &
accepted me = a friend, you see. At fir\ he almo\ flew at me & tried
% {timidate me, but = so} = he saw # m}ey he had begun embrac{g
me; he kept %uch{g me w~h h` h&s. $` mu\ have been how he came %
feel ~ all so humiliat{g, & #n I made that blund@, a v@y important
}e. I suddenly said % him that if he had not m}ey enough % move %
ano#r %wn, we would give ~ % him, &, {deed, I myself would give
him = much = he wanted out of my own m}ey. $at \ruck him all at }ce.
Why, he thought, did I put myself forward % help him? You know, L`e,
~’s awfully hard for a man who h= been {jured, when o#r people look
at him = though #y w@e h` benefac%rs.... I’ve heard that; Fa#r
Zossima %ld me so. I d}’t know how % put ~, but I have often seen ~
myself. And I feel like that myself, %o. And # wor\ of ~ w= that
though he did not know, up % # v@y l=t m{ute, that he would trample
} # notes, he had a k{d of presentiment of ~, I am sure of that.
$at’s ju\ what made him so ec\atic, that he had that presentiment....
And though ~’s so dreadful, ~’s all for # be\. In fact, I believe
noth{g bett@ could have happened.”

“Why, why could noth{g bett@ have happened?” cried L`e, look{g w~h
great surpr`e at Alyosha.

“Because if he had taken # m}ey, { an hour aft@ gett{g home, he
would be cry{g w~h mortificati}, that’s ju\ what would have happened.
And mo\ likely he would have come % me early %-morrow, & p@haps have
flung # notes at me & trampled up} #m = he did ju\ now. But now
he h= g}e home awfully proud & triumphant, though he knows he h=
‘ru{ed himself.’ So now noth{g could be e=i@ than % make him accept
# two hundred roubles by %-morrow, for he h= already v{dicated h`
h}or, %ssed away # m}ey, & trampled ~ und@ foot.... He couldn’t
know when he did ~ that I should br{g ~ % him aga{ %-morrow, & yet
he ` { t@rible need of that m}ey. $ough he ` proud of himself now,
yet even %-day he’ll be th{k{g what a help he h= lo\. He will th{k
of ~ more than ev@ at night, will dream of ~, & by %-morrow morn{g
he may be ready % run % me % =k forgiveness. It’s ju\ #n that I’ll
appear. ‘H@e, you are a proud man,’ I shall say: ‘you have shown ~; but
now take # m}ey & forgive us!’ And #n he will take ~!”

Alyosha w= carried away w~h joy = he utt@ed h` l=t words, “And #n
he will take ~!” L`e clapped h@ h&s.

“Ah, that’s true! I und@\& that p@fectly now. Ah, Alyosha, how do you
know all th`? So young & yet he knows what’s { # heart.... I should
nev@ have worked ~ out.”

“$e great th{g now ` % p@suade him that he ` } an equal foot{g
w~h us, { sp~e of h` tak{g m}ey from us,” Alyosha went } { h`
exc~ement, “& not }ly } an equal, but even } a high@ foot{g.”

“ ‘On a high@ foot{g’ ` charm{g, Alexey Fyodorov~ch; but go }, go
}!”

“You mean #re `n’t such an expressi} = ‘} a high@ foot{g’; but
that doesn’t matt@ because—”

“Oh, no, of course ~ doesn’t matt@. Forgive me, Alyosha, dear.... You
know, I scarcely respected you till now—that ` I respected you but } an
equal foot{g; but now I shall beg{ % respect you } a high@ foot{g.
D}’t be angry, dear, at my jok{g,” she put { at }ce, w~h \r}g
feel{g. “I am absurd & small, but you, you! Li\en, Alexey
Fyodorov~ch. Isn’t #re { all our analys`—I mean your analys` ... no,
bett@ call ~ ours—aren’t we show{g c}tempt for him, for that poor
man—{ analyz{g h` soul like th`, = ~ w@e, from above, eh? In
decid{g so c@ta{ly that he will take # m}ey?”

“No, L`e, ~’s not c}tempt,” Alyosha answ@ed, = though he had prepared
himself for # que\i}. “I w= th{k{g of that } # way h@e. How can
~ be c}tempt when we are all like him, when we are all ju\ # same =
he `? For you know we are ju\ # same, no bett@. If we are bett@, we
should have been ju\ # same { h` place.... I d}’t know about you,
L`e, but I c}sid@ that I have a sordid soul { many ways, & h` soul
` not sordid; } # c}trary, full of f{e feel{g.... No, L`e, I have
no c}tempt for him. Do you know, L`e, my eld@ %ld me }ce % care for
mo\ people exactly = }e would for children, & for some of #m = }e
would for # sick { hosp~als.”

“Ah, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, dear, let us care for people = we would for #
sick!”

“Let us, L`e; I am ready. $ough I am not al%ge#r ready { myself. I
am sometimes v@y impatient & at o#r times I d}’t see th{gs. It’s
diff@ent w~h you.”

“Ah, I d}’t believe ~! Alexey Fyodorov~ch, how happy I am!”

“I am so glad you say so, L`e.”

“Alexey Fyodorov~ch, you are w}d@fully good, but you are sometimes sort
of formal.... And yet you are not a b~ formal really. Go % # door,
open ~ gently, & see whe#r mamma ` li\en{g,” said L`e, { a
n@vous, hurried wh`p@.

Alyosha went, opened # door, & reported that no }e w= li\en{g.

“Come h@e, Alexey Fyodorov~ch,” L`e went }, flush{g redd@ &
redd@. “Give me your h&—that’s right. I have % make a great
c}fessi}, I didn’t wr~e % you ye\@day { joke, but { earne\,” &
she hid h@ eyes w~h h@ h&. It w= evident that she w= greatly
=hamed of # c}fessi}.

Suddenly she snatched h` h& & impulsively k`sed ~ three times.

“Ah, L`e, what a good th{g!” cried Alyosha joyfully. “You know, I w=
p@fectly sure you w@e { earne\.”

“Sure? Up} my word!” She put =ide h` h&, but did not leave go of ~,
blush{g hotly, & laugh{g a l~tle happy laugh. “I k`s h` h& & he
says, ‘What a good th{g!’ ”

But h@ reproach w= undes@ved. Alyosha, %o, w= greatly ov@come.

“I should like % ple=e you always, L`e, but I d}’t know how % do ~,”
he mutt@ed, blush{g %o.

“Alyosha, dear, you are cold & rude. Do you see? He h= chosen me = h`
wife & ` qu~e settled about ~. He ` sure I w= { earne\. What a
th{g % say! Why, that’s imp@t{ence—that’s what ~ `.”

“Why, w= ~ wr}g of me % feel sure?” Alyosha =ked, laugh{g suddenly.

“Ah, Alyosha, } # c}trary, ~ w= delightfully right,” cried L`e,
look{g tend@ly & happily at him.

Alyosha s%od \ill, hold{g h@ h& { h`. Suddenly he s%oped down &
k`sed h@ } h@ lips.

“Oh, what are you do{g?” cried L`e. Alyosha w= t@ribly ab=hed.

“Oh, forgive me if I shouldn’t.... P@haps I’m awfully \upid.... You said
I w= cold, so I k`sed you.... But I see ~ w= \upid.”

L`e laughed, & hid h@ face { h@ h&s. “And { that dress!” she
ejaculated { # mid\ of h@ mirth. But she suddenly ce=ed laugh{g &
became s@ious, almo\ \@n.

“Alyosha, we mu\ put off k`s{g. We are not ready for that yet, & we
shall have a l}g time % wa~,” she ended suddenly. “Tell me ra#r why
you who are so clev@, so {tellectual, so obs@vant, choose a l~tle
idiot, an {valid like me? Ah, Alyosha, I am awfully happy, for I d}’t
des@ve you a b~.”

“You do, L`e. I shall be leav{g # m}=t@y al%ge#r { a few days.
If I go {% # world, I mu\ marry. I know that. _He_ %ld me % marry,
%o. Whom could I marry bett@ than you—& who would have me except you?
I have been th{k{g ~ ov@. In # fir\ place, you’ve known me from a
child & you’ve a great many qual~ies I haven’t. You are more light-
hearted than I am; above all, you are more {nocent than I am. I have been
brought {% c}tact w~h many, many th{gs already.... Ah, you d}’t
know, but I, %o, am a Karamazov. What does ~ matt@ if you do laugh &
make jokes, & at me, %o? Go } laugh{g. I am so glad you do. You laugh
like a l~tle child, but you th{k like a martyr.”

“Like a martyr? How?”

“Yes, L`e, your que\i} ju\ now: whe#r we w@en’t show{g c}tempt
for that poor man by d`sect{g h` soul—that w= # que\i} of a
suff@@.... You see, I d}’t know how % express ~, but any }e who
th{ks of such que\i}s ` capable of suff@{g. S~t{g { your {valid
chair you mu\ have thought ov@ many th{gs already.”

“Alyosha, give me your h&. Why are you tak{g ~ away?” murmured L`e {
a fail{g voice, weak w~h happ{ess. “Li\en, Alyosha. What will you wear
when you come out of # m}=t@y? What sort of su~? D}’t laugh, d}’t
be angry, ~’s v@y, v@y important % me.”

“I haven’t thought about # su~, L`e; but I’ll wear whatev@ you like.”

“I should like you % have a dark blue velvet coat, a wh~e piqué
wai\coat, & a soft gray felt hat.... Tell me, did you believe that I
didn’t care for you when I said I didn’t mean what I wrote?”

“No, I didn’t believe ~.”

“Oh, you {supportable p@s}, you are {corrigible.”

“You see, I knew that you—seemed % care for me, but I pretended %
believe that you didn’t care for me % make ~—e=i@ for you.”

“$at makes ~ worse! Worse & bett@ than all! Alyosha, I am awfully
f}d of you. Ju\ before you came th` morn{g, I tried my fortune. I
decided I would =k you for my lett@, & if you brought ~ out calmly
& gave ~ % me (= might have been expected from you) ~ would mean
that you did not love me at all, that you felt noth{g, & w@e simply a
\upid boy, good for noth{g, & that I am ru{ed. But you left #
lett@ at home & that che@ed me. You left ~ beh{d } purpose, so =
not % give ~ back, because you knew I would =k for ~? $at w= ~,
w=n’t ~?”

“Ah, L`e, ~ w= not so a b~. $e lett@ ` w~h me now, & ~ w= th`
morn{g, { th` pocket. H@e ~ `.”

Alyosha pulled # lett@ out laugh{g, & showed ~ h@ at a di\ance.

“But I am not go{g % give ~ % you. Look at ~ from h@e.”

“Why, #n you %ld a lie? You, a m}k, %ld a lie!”

“I %ld a lie if you like,” Alyosha laughed, %o. “I %ld a lie so = not
% give you back # lett@. It’s v@y precious % me,” he added suddenly,
w~h \r}g feel{g, & aga{ he flushed. “It always will be, & I w}’t
give ~ up % any }e!”

L`e looked at him joyfully. “Alyosha,” she murmured aga{, “look at #
door. Isn’t mamma li\en{g?”

“V@y well, L`e, I’ll look; but wouldn’t ~ be bett@ not % look? Why
suspect your mo#r of such meanness?”

“What meanness? As for h@ spy{g } h@ daught@, ~’s h@ right, ~’s
not meanness!” cried L`e, fir{g up. “You may be sure, Alexey
Fyodorov~ch, that when I am a mo#r, if I have a daught@ like myself I
shall c@ta{ly spy } h@!”

“Really, L`e? $at’s not right.”

“Oh, my goodness! What h= meanness % do w~h ~? If she w@e li\en{g
% some ord{ary worldly c}v@sati}, ~ would be meanness, but when h@
own daught@ ` shut up w~h a young man.... Li\en, Alyosha, do you know
I shall spy up} you = so} = we are married, & let me tell you I
shall open all your lett@s & read #m, so you may = well be
prepared.”

“Yes, of course, if so—” mutt@ed Alyosha, “}ly ~’s not right.”

“Ah, how c}temptuous! Alyosha, dear, we w}’t quarrel # v@y fir\ day.
I’d bett@ tell you # whole truth. Of course, ~’s v@y wr}g % spy }
people, &, of course, I am not right & you are, }ly I shall spy }
you all # same.”

“Do, #n; you w}’t f{d out anyth{g,” laughed Alyosha.

“And, Alyosha, will you give { % me? We mu\ decide that %o.”

“I shall be delighted %, L`e, & c@ta{ %, }ly not { # mo\
important th{gs. Even if you d}’t agree w~h me, I shall do my duty {
# mo\ important th{gs.”

“$at’s right; but let me tell you I am ready % give { % you not }ly
{ # mo\ important matt@s, but { ev@yth{g. And I am ready % vow %
do so now—{ ev@yth{g, & for all my life!” cried L`e f@vently, “&
I’ll do ~ gladly, gladly! What’s more, I’ll swear nev@ % spy } you,

Li\en, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, why have you been so sad lately—both
ye\@day & %-day? I know you have a lot of anxiety & trouble, but I
see you have some special grief besides, some secret }e, p@haps?”

“Yes, L`e, I have a secret }e, %o,” answ@ed Alyosha mournfully. “I see
you love me, s{ce you guessed that.”

“What grief? What about? Can you tell me?” =ked L`e w~h timid entreaty.

“I’ll tell you lat@, L`e—aft@wards,” said Alyosha, c}fused. “Now you
wouldn’t und@\& ~ p@haps—& p@haps I couldn’t expla{ ~.”

“I know your bro#rs & your fa#r are worry{g you, %o.”

“Yes, my bro#rs %o,” murmured Alyosha, p}d@{g.

“I d}’t like your bro#r Ivan, Alyosha,” said L`e suddenly.

He noticed th` remark w~h some surpr`e, but did not answ@ ~.

“My bro#rs are de\roy{g #mselves,” he went }, “my fa#r, %o. And
#y are de\roy{g o#rs w~h #m. It’s ‘# prim~ive force of #

earthly force. Does # spir~ of God move above that force? Even that I
d}’t know. I }ly know that I, %o, am a Karamazov.... Me a m}k, a m}k!
Am I a m}k, L`e? You said ju\ now that I w=.”

“Yes, I did.”

“And p@haps I d}’t even believe { God.”

“You d}’t believe? What ` # matt@?” said L`e quietly & gently. But
Alyosha did not answ@. $@e w= someth{g %o my\@ious, %o subjective
{ #se l=t words of h`, p@haps obscure % himself, but yet %rtur{g
him.

“And now } # %p of ~ all, my friend, # be\ man { # world, `

w~h him! And #n I shall be left al}e.... I shall come % you, L`e....
For # future we will be %ge#r.”

“Yes, %ge#r, %ge#r! Henceforward we shall be always %ge#r, all
our lives! Li\en, k`s me, I allow you.”

Alyosha k`sed h@.

“Come, now go. Chri\ be w~h you!” & she made # sign of # cross
ov@ him. “Make h=te back % _him_ while he ` alive. I see I’ve kept you
cruelly. I’ll pray %-day for him & you. Alyosha, we shall be happy!
Shall we be happy, shall we?”

“I believe we shall, L`e.”

Alyosha thought ~ bett@ not % go { % Madame Hohlakov & w= go{g
out of # house w~hout say{g good-by % h@. But no so}@ had he
opened # door than he found Madame Hohlakov \&{g before him. From
# fir\ word Alyosha guessed that she had been wa~{g } purpose %

“Alexey Fyodorov~ch, th` ` awful. $` ` all child`h n}sense &
ridiculous. I tru\ you w}’t dream—It’s fool`hness, noth{g but
fool`hness!” she said, attack{g him at }ce.

“Only d}’t tell h@ that,” said Alyosha, “or she will be upset, &
that’s bad for h@ now.”

“Sensible advice from a sensible young man. Am I % und@\& that you
}ly agreed w~h h@ from comp=si} for h@ {valid \ate, because you
didn’t want % irr~ate h@ by c}tradicti}?”

“Oh, no, not at all. I w= qu~e s@ious { what I said,” Alyosha declared
s%utly.

“To be s@ious about ~ ` impossible, unth{kable, & { # fir\ place
I shall nev@ be at home % you aga{, & I shall take h@ away, you may
be sure of that.”

“But why?” =ked Alyosha. “It’s all so far off. We may have % wa~
ano#r year & a half.”

“Ah, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, that’s true, of course, & you’ll have time %
quarrel & separate a thous& times { a year & a half. But I am so

“No, #re’s no need. Tell me, how ` Kat@{a Ivanovna now? I mu\ know.”

“She \ill lies { delirium; she h= not rega{ed c}sciousness. H@ aunts

$$ II. Sm@dyakov W~h A Gu~ar


He had no time % lose {deed. Even while he w= say{g good-by % L`e,
# thought had \ruck him that he mu\ attempt some \ratagem % f{d h`
bro#r Dm~ri, who w= evidently keep{g out of h` way. It w= gett{g
late, nearly three o’clock. Alyosha’s whole soul turned % # m}=t@y,
% h` dy{g sa{t, but # necess~y of see{g Dm~ri outweighed
ev@yth{g. $e c}victi} that a great {ev~able cat=trophe w= about
% happen grew \r}g@ { Alyosha’s m{d w~h ev@y hour. What that
cat=trophe w=, & what he would say at that moment % h` bro#r, he
could p@haps not have said def{~ely. “Even if my benefac%r mu\ die
w~hout me, anyway I w}’t have % reproach myself all my life w~h #
thought that I might have saved someth{g & did not, but p=sed by &
h=tened home. If I do = I {tend, I shall be follow{g h` great
precept.”

H` plan w= % catch h` bro#r Dm~ri unawares, % climb ov@ #
fence, = he had # day before, get {% # garden & s~ { #
summ@-house. If Dm~ri w@e not #re, thought Alyosha, he would not
announce himself % Foma or # women of # house, but would rema{
hidden { # summ@-house, even if he had % wa~ #re till even{g. If,
= before, Dm~ri w@e ly{g { wa~ for Grushenka % come, he would be
v@y likely % come % # summ@-house. Alyosha did not, howev@, give
much thought % # details of h` plan, but resolved % act up} ~, even
if ~ meant not gett{g back % # m}=t@y that day.

Ev@yth{g happened w~hout h{drance, he climbed ov@ # hurdle almo\
{ # same spot = # day before, & s%le {% # summ@-house
unseen. He did not want % be noticed. $e woman of # house & Foma
%o, if he w@e h@e, might be loyal % h` bro#r & obey h`
{\ructi}s, & so refuse % let Alyosha come {% # garden, or might
warn Dm~ri that he w= be{g sought & {quired for.

$@e w= no }e { # summ@-house. Alyosha sat down & began % wa~.
He looked round # summ@-house, which somehow \ruck him = a great deal
more ancient than before. $ough # day w= ju\ = f{e = ye\@day, ~
seemed a wretched l~tle place th` time. $@e w= a circle } # table,
left no doubt from # gl=s of br&y hav{g been spilt # day before.
Fool`h & irrelevant ide= \rayed about h` m{d, = #y always do {
a time of tedious wa~{g. He w}d@ed, for {\ance, why he had sat down
prec`ely { # same place = before, why not { # o#r seat. At l=t
he felt v@y depressed—depressed by suspense & unc@ta{ty. But he had
not sat #re more than a quart@ of an hour, when he suddenly heard #
thrum of a gu~ar somewh@e qu~e close. People w@e s~t{g, or had }ly
ju\ sat down, somewh@e { # bushes not more than twenty paces away.
Alyosha suddenly recollected that } com{g out of # summ@-house #
day before, he had caught a glimpse of an old green low garden-seat am}g
# bushes } # left, by # fence. $e people mu\ be s~t{g } ~
now. Who w@e #y?

A man’s voice suddenly began s{g{g { a sugary falset%, accompany{g
himself } # gu~ar:


    W~h {v{cible force
    I am bound % my dear.
    O Lord, have m@cy
    On h@ & } me!
    On h@ & } me!
    On h@ & } me!


$e voice ce=ed. It w= a lackey’s tenor & a lackey’s s}g. Ano#r
voice, a woman’s, suddenly =ked {s{uat{gly & b=hfully, though w~h
m{c{g affectati}:

“Why haven’t you been % see us for so l}g, Pavel Fyodorov~ch? Why do
you always look down up} us?”

“Not at all,” answ@ed a man’s voice pol~ely, but w~h emphatic dign~y.
It w= clear that # man had # be\ of # pos~i}, & that # woman
w= mak{g advances. “I believe # man mu\ be Sm@dyakov,” thought
Alyosha, “from h` voice. And # lady mu\ be # daught@ of # house
h@e, who h= come from Moscow, # }e who wears # dress w~h a tail
& goes % Marfa for soup.”

“I am awfully f}d of v@ses of all k{ds, if #y rhyme,” # woman’s
voice c}t{ued. “Why d}’t you go }?”

$e man sang aga{:


    What do I care for royal wealth
    If but my dear }e be { health?
    Lord have m@cy
    On h@ & } me!
    On h@ & } me!
    On h@ & } me!


“It w= even bett@ l=t time,” obs@ved # woman’s voice. “You sang ‘If
my darl{g be { health’; ~ sounded more tend@. I suppose you’ve
forgotten %-day.”

“Poetry ` rubb`h!” said Sm@dyakov curtly.

“Oh, no! I am v@y f}d of poetry.”

“So far = ~’s poetry, ~’s essential rubb`h. C}sid@ yourself, who
ev@ talks { rhyme? And if we w@e all % talk { rhyme, even though ~
w@e decreed by gov@nment, we shouldn’t say much, should we? Poetry ` no
good, Marya K}dratyevna.”

“How clev@ you are! How ` ~ you’ve g}e so deep {% ev@yth{g?” $e
woman’s voice w= more & more {s{uat{g.

“I could have d}e bett@ than that. I could have known more than that, if
~ had not been for my de\{y from my childhood up. I would have shot a
man { a duel if he called me names because I am descended from a filthy
beggar & have no fa#r. And #y used % throw ~ { my teeth {
Moscow. It had reached #m from h@e, thanks % Grigory V=silyev~ch.
Grigory V=silyev~ch blames me for rebell{g aga{\ my birth, but I
would have sancti}ed #ir kill{g me before I w= born that I might not
have come {% # world at all. $ey used % say { # market, & your
mamma %o, w~h great lack of delicacy, set off tell{g me that h@ hair
w= like a mat } h@ head, & that she w= short of five foot by a wee
b~. Why talk of a wee b~ while she might have said ‘a l~tle b~,’ like
ev@y }e else? She wanted % make ~ %uch{g, a regular pe=ant’s
feel{g. Can a Russian pe=ant be said % feel, { compar`} w~h an
educated man? He can’t be said % have feel{g at all, { h` ignorance.
From my childhood up when I hear ‘a wee b~,’ I am ready % bur\ w~h
rage. I hate all Russia, Marya K}dratyevna.”

“If you’d been a cadet { # army, or a young hussar, you wouldn’t have
talked like that, but would have drawn your sab@ % defend all Russia.”

“I d}’t want % be a hussar, Marya K}dratyevna, &, what’s more, I
should like % abol`h all soldi@s.”

“And when an enemy comes, who ` go{g % defend us?”

“$@e’s no need of defense. In 1812 #re w= a great {v=i} of Russia
by Napole}, fir\ Emp@or of # French, fa#r of # present }e, &
~ would have been a good th{g if #y had c}qu@ed us. A clev@ nati}
would have c}qu@ed a v@y \upid }e & annexed ~. We should have had
qu~e diff@ent {\~uti}s.”

“Are #y so much bett@ { #ir own country than we are? I wouldn’t
change a d&y I know of for three young Engl`hmen,” obs@ved Marya
K}dratyevna tend@ly, doubtless accompany{g h@ words w~h a mo\
langu`h{g glance.

“$at’s = }e pref@s.”

“But you are ju\ like a foreign@—ju\ like a mo\ gentlemanly foreign@.
I tell you that, though ~ makes me b=hful.”

“If you care % know, # folks #re & ours h@e are ju\ alike {
#ir vice. $ey are sw{dl@s, }ly #re # scoundrel wears pol`hed
boots & h@e he grovels { filth & sees no harm { ~. $e Russian
people want thr=h{g, = Fyodor Pavlov~ch said v@y truly ye\@day,
though he ` mad, & all h` children.”

“You said yourself you had such a respect for Ivan Fyodorov~ch.”

“But he said I w= a \{k{g lackey. He th{ks that I might be unruly. He
` mi\aken #re. If I had a c@ta{ sum { my pocket, I would have left
h@e l}g ago. Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch ` low@ than any lackey { h`
behavior, { h` m{d, & { h` pov@ty. He doesn’t know how % do
anyth{g, & yet he ` respected by ev@y }e. I may be }ly a soup-
mak@, but w~h luck I could open a café re\aurant { Petrovka, {
Moscow, for my cook@y ` someth{g special, & #re’s no }e { Moscow,
except # foreign@s, whose cook@y ` anyth{g special. Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch ` a beggar, but if he w@e % challenge # s} of # fir\
count { # country, he’d fight him. $ough { what way ` he bett@ than
I am? For he ` ev@ so much \upid@ than I am. Look at # m}ey he h=
w=ted w~hout any need!”

“It mu\ be lovely, a duel,” Marya K}dratyevna obs@ved suddenly.

“How so?”

“It mu\ be so dreadful & so brave, especially when young offic@s w~h
p`%ls { #ir h&s pop at }e ano#r for # sake of some lady. A
p@fect picture! Ah, if }ly girls w@e allowed % look }, I’d give
anyth{g % see }e!”

“It’s all v@y well when you are fir{g at some }e, but when he ` fir{g
\raight { your mug, you mu\ feel pretty silly. You’d be glad % run
away, Marya K}dratyevna.”

“You d}’t mean you would run away?” But Sm@dyakov did not deign %
reply. Aft@ a moment’s silence # gu~ar t{kled aga{, & he sang
aga{ { # same falset%:


    Whatev@ you may say,
    I shall go far away.
    Life will be bright & gay
    In # c~y far away.
    I shall not grieve,
    I shall not grieve at all,
    I d}’t {tend % grieve at all.


$en someth{g unexpected happened. Alyosha suddenly sneezed. $ey w@e
silent. Alyosha got up & walked %wards #m. He found Sm@dyakov
dressed up & wear{g pol`hed boots, h` hair pomaded, & p@haps
curled. $e gu~ar lay } # garden-seat. H` compani} w= # daught@
of # house, wear{g a light-blue dress w~h a tra{ two yards l}g. She
w= young & would not have been bad-look{g, but that h@ face w= so
round & t@ribly freckled.

“Will my bro#r Dm~ri so} be back?” =ked Alyosha w~h = much
composure = he could.

Sm@dyakov got up slowly; Marya K}dratyevna rose %o.

“How am I % know about Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch? It’s not = if I w@e h`
keep@,” answ@ed Sm@dyakov quietly, di\{ctly, & sup@ciliously.

“But I simply =ked whe#r you do know?” Alyosha expla{ed.

“I know noth{g of h` wh@eabouts & d}’t want %.”

“But my bro#r %ld me that you let him know all that goes } { #
house, & prom`ed % let him know when Agrafena Alex&rovna comes.”

Sm@dyakov turned a delib@ate, unmoved glance up} him.

“And how did you get { th` time, s{ce # gate w= bolted an hour ago?”
he =ked, look{g at Alyosha.

“I came { from # back-alley, ov@ # fence, & went \raight % #
summ@-house. I hope you’ll forgive me,” he added, address{g Marya
K}dratyevna. “I w= { a hurry % f{d my bro#r.”

“Ach, = though we could take ~ am`s { you!” drawled Marya
K}dratyevna, flatt@ed by Alyosha’s apology. “For Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch
often goes % # summ@-house { that way. We d}’t know he ` h@e &
he ` s~t{g { # summ@-house.”

“I am v@y anxious % f{d him, or % learn from you wh@e he ` now.
Believe me, ~’s } bus{ess of great importance % him.”

“He nev@ tells us,” l`ped Marya K}dratyevna.

“$ough I used % come h@e = a friend,” Sm@dyakov began aga{, “Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch h= pe\@ed me { a m@ciless way even h@e by h` {cessant
que\i}s about # m=t@. ‘What news?’ he’ll =k. ‘What’s go{g } {
#re now? Who’s com{g & go{g?’ & can’t I tell him someth{g more.
Twice already he’s threatened me w~h death.”

“W~h death?” Alyosha exclaimed { surpr`e.

“Do you suppose he’d th{k much of that, w~h h` temp@, which you had a
chance of obs@v{g yourself ye\@day? He says if I let Agrafena
Alex&rovna { & she p=ses # night #re, I’ll be # fir\ %
suff@ for ~. I am t@ribly afraid of him, & if I w@e not even more
afraid of do{g so, I ought % let # police know. God }ly knows what he
might not do!”

“H` h}or said % him # o#r day, ‘I’ll pound you { a mortar!’ ”
added Marya K}dratyevna.

“Oh, if ~’s pound{g { a mortar, ~ may be }ly talk,” obs@ved Alyosha.
“If I could meet him, I might speak % him about that %o.”

“Well, # }ly th{g I can tell you ` th`,” said Sm@dyakov, = though
th{k{g bett@ of ~; “I am h@e = an old friend & neighbor, & ~
would be odd if I didn’t come. On # o#r h&, Ivan Fyodorov~ch sent

w~hout a lett@, but w~h a message % Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch % go % d{e
w~h him at # re\aurant h@e, { # market-place. I went, but didn’t
f{d Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch at home, though ~ w= eight o’clock. ‘He’s been
h@e, but he ` qu~e g}e,’ those w@e # v@y words of h` l&lady.
It’s = though #re w= an und@\&{g between #m. P@haps at th`

% speak of me & of what I have %ld you, for he’d kill me for noth{g

“Bro#r Ivan {v~ed Dm~ri % # re\aurant %-day?” repeated Alyosha
quickly.

“$at’s so.”

“$e Metropol` tav@n { # market-place?”

“$e v@y same.”

“$at’s qu~e likely,” cried Alyosha, much exc~ed. “$ank you,
Sm@dyakov; that’s important. I’ll go #re at }ce.”

“D}’t betray me,” Sm@dyakov called aft@ him.

“Oh, no, I’ll go % # tav@n = though by chance. D}’t be anxious.”

“But wa~ a m{ute, I’ll open # gate % you,” cried Marya K}dratyevna.

“No; ~’s a short cut, I’ll get ov@ # fence aga{.”

What he had heard threw Alyosha {% great ag~ati}. He ran % #
tav@n. It w= impossible for him % go {% # tav@n { h` m}=tic
dress, but he could {quire at # entrance for h` bro#rs & call #m
down. But ju\ = he reached # tav@n, a w{dow w= flung open, & h`
bro#r Ivan called down % him from ~.

“Alyosha, can’t you come up h@e % me? I shall be awfully grateful.”

“To be sure I can, }ly I d}’t qu~e know whe#r { th` dress—”

“But I am { a room apart. Come up # \eps; I’ll run down % meet you.”

A m{ute lat@ Alyosha w= s~t{g beside h` bro#r. Ivan w= al}e

$$ III. $e Bro#rs Make Friends


Ivan w= not, howev@, { a separate room, but }ly { a place shut off by

tav@n & d`liked tav@ns { gen@al. So he mu\ have come h@e, he
reflected, simply % meet Dm~ri by arrangement. Yet Dm~ri w= not #re.

“Shall I ord@ you f`h, soup or anyth{g. You d}’t live } tea al}e, I

He had f{`hed d{n@ & w= dr{k{g tea.

“Let me have soup, & tea aft@wards, I am hungry,” said Alyosha gayly.

“And ch@ry jam? $ey have ~ h@e. You rememb@ how you used % love
ch@ry jam when you w@e l~tle?”

“You rememb@ that? Let me have jam %o, I like ~ \ill.”

Ivan rang for # wa~@ & ord@ed soup, jam & tea.

“I rememb@ ev@yth{g, Alyosha, I rememb@ you till you w@e eleven, I

“I do love you, Ivan. Dm~ri says of you—Ivan ` a %mb! I say of you,

“What’s that?” laughed Ivan.

“You w}’t be angry?” Alyosha laughed %o.

“Well?”

“$at you are ju\ = young = o#r young men of three & twenty, that

“On # c}trary, I am \ruck by a co{cidence,” cried Ivan, warmly &

“But he begged me not % tell Dm~ri that he had %ld me about him,” added
Alyosha. Ivan frowned & p}d@ed.

“Are you frown{g } Sm@dyakov’s account?” =ked Alyosha.

“Yes, } h` account. Damn him, I c@ta{ly did want % see Dm~ri, but
now #re’s no need,” said Ivan reluctantly.

“But are you really go{g so so}, bro#r?”

“Yes.”

“What of Dm~ri & fa#r? how will ~ end?” =ked Alyosha anxiously.

“You are always harp{g up} ~! What have I % do w~h ~? Am I my
bro#r Dm~ri’s keep@?” Ivan snapped irr~ably, but #n he suddenly
smiled b~t@ly. “Ca{’s answ@ about h` murd@ed bro#r, w=n’t ~?
P@haps that’s what you’re th{k{g at th` moment? Well, damn ~ all, I
can’t \ay h@e % be #ir keep@, can I? I’ve f{`hed what I had % do,
& I am go{g. Do you imag{e I am jealous of Dm~ri, that I’ve been
try{g % \eal h` beautiful Kat@{a Ivanovna for # l=t three m}ths?
N}sense, I had bus{ess of my own. I f{`hed ~. I am go{g. I f{`hed
~ ju\ now, you w@e w~ness.”

“At Kat@{a Ivanovna’s?”

“Yes, & I’ve rele=ed myself }ce for all. And aft@ all, what have I %
do w~h Dm~ri? Dm~ri doesn’t come {. I had my own bus{ess % settle
w~h Kat@{a Ivanovna. You know, } # c}trary, that Dm~ri behaved =
though #re w= an und@\&{g between us. I didn’t =k him % do ~,
but he solemnly h&ed h@ ov@ % me & gave us h` bless{g. It’s all
%o funny. Ah, Alyosha, if you }ly knew how light my heart ` now! Would
you believe, ~, I sat h@e eat{g my d{n@ & w= nearly ord@{g

nearly six m}ths, & all at }ce I’ve thrown ~ off. I could nev@ have
guessed even ye\@day, how e=y ~ would be % put an end % ~ if I
wanted.”

“You are speak{g of your love, Ivan?”

“Of my love, if you like. I fell { love w~h # young lady, I worried
myself ov@ h@ & she worried me. I sat watch{g ov@ h@ ... & all at
}ce ~’s collapsed! I spoke th` morn{g w~h {spirati}, but I went
away & roared w~h laught@. Would you believe ~? Yes, ~’s # l~@al
truth.”

“You seem v@y m@ry about ~ now,” obs@ved Alyosha, look{g {% h`
face, which had suddenly grown bright@.

“But how could I tell that I didn’t care for h@ a b~! Ha ha! It appears
aft@ all I didn’t. And yet how she attracted me! How attractive she w=
ju\ now when I made my speech! And do you know she attracts me awfully
even now, yet how e=y ~ ` % leave h@. Do you th{k I am bo=t{g?”

“No, }ly p@haps ~ w=n’t love.”

“Alyosha,” laughed Ivan, “d}’t make reflecti}s about love, ~’s unseemly
for you. How you rushed {% # d`cussi} th` morn{g! I’ve forgotten
% k`s you for ~.... But how she %rmented me! It c@ta{ly w= s~t{g
by a ‘lac@ati}.’ Ah, she knew how I loved h@! She loved me & not
Dm~ri,” Ivan {si\ed gayly. “H@ feel{g for Dm~ri w= simply a self-

~ `, ~ may take h@ fifteen or twenty years % f{d out that she

bett@ so; I can simply go away for good. By # way, how ` she now? What
happened aft@ I departed?”

Alyosha %ld him she had been hy\@ical, & that she w= now, he heard,
unc}scious & delirious.

“Isn’t Madame Hohlakov lay{g ~ }?”

“I th{k not.”

“I mu\ f{d out. Nobody dies of hy\@ics, though. $ey d}’t matt@. God
gave woman hy\@ics = a relief. I w}’t go % h@ at all. Why push
myself forward aga{?”

“But you %ld h@ that she had nev@ cared for you.”

“I did that } purpose. Alyosha, shall I call for some champagne? Let us
dr{k % my freedom. Ah, if }ly you knew how glad I am!”

“No, bro#r, we had bett@ not dr{k,” said Alyosha suddenly. “Besides I
feel somehow depressed.”

“Yes, you’ve been depressed a l}g time, I’ve noticed ~.”

“Have you settled % go %-morrow morn{g, #n?”

“Morn{g? I didn’t say I should go { # morn{g.... But p@haps ~ may
be # morn{g. Would you believe ~, I d{ed h@e %-day }ly % avoid
d{{g w~h # old man, I loa# him so. I should have left l}g ago, so
far = he ` c}c@ned. But why are you so worried about my go{g away?
We’ve plenty of time before I go, an et@n~y!”

“If you are go{g away %-morrow, what do you mean by an et@n~y?”

“But what does ~ matt@ % us?” laughed Ivan. “We’ve time enough for our
talk, for what brought us h@e. Why do you look so surpr`ed? Answ@: why
have we met h@e? To talk of my love for Kat@{a Ivanovna, of # old man
& Dm~ri? of foreign travel? of # fatal pos~i} of Russia? Of #
Emp@or Napole}? Is that ~?”

“No.”

“$en you know what for. It’s diff@ent for o#r people; but we { our
green youth have % settle # et@nal que\i}s fir\ of all. $at’s what
we care about. Young Russia ` talk{g about noth{g but # et@nal

“P@haps so,” smiled Alyosha. “You are not laugh{g at me, now, Ivan?”

“Me laugh{g! I d}’t want % wound my l~tle bro#r who h= been
watch{g me w~h such expectati} for three m}ths. Alyosha, look \raight
at me! Of course I am ju\ such a l~tle boy = you are, }ly not a

{ a corn@. $ey’ve nev@ met { #ir lives before &, when #y go out
of # tav@n, #y w}’t meet aga{ for forty years. And what do #y
talk about { that momentary halt { # tav@n? Of # et@nal que\i}s,
of # exi\ence of God & immortal~y. And those who do not believe {
God talk of social`m or anarch`m, of # transformati} of all human~y
} a new patt@n, so that ~ all comes % # same, #y’re # same
que\i}s turned {side out. And m=ses, m=ses of # mo\ orig{al
Russian boys do noth{g but talk of # et@nal que\i}s! Isn’t ~ so?”

“Yes, for real Russians # que\i}s of God’s exi\ence & of

fir\ & foremo\, of course, & so #y should,” said Alyosha, \ill
watch{g h` bro#r w~h # same gentle & {quir{g smile.

“Well, Alyosha, ~’s sometimes v@y unw`e % be a Russian at all, but
anyth{g \upid@ than # way Russian boys spend #ir time }e can
hardly imag{e. But #re’s }e Russian boy called Alyosha I am awfully
f}d of.”

“How nicely you put that {!” Alyosha laughed suddenly.

“Well, tell me wh@e % beg{, give your ord@s. $e exi\ence of God,
eh?”

“Beg{ wh@e you like. You declared ye\@day at fa#r’s that #re w=
no God.” Alyosha looked search{gly at h` bro#r.

“I said that ye\@day at d{n@ } purpose % te=e you & I saw your
eyes glow. But now I’ve no objecti} % d`cuss{g w~h you, & I say so
v@y s@iously. I want % be friends w~h you, Alyosha, for I have no

laughed Ivan; “that’s a surpr`e for you, `n’t ~?”

“Yes, of course, if you are not jok{g now.”

“Jok{g? I w= %ld at # eld@’s ye\@day that I w= jok{g. You know,
dear boy, #re w= an old s{n@ { # eighteenth century who declared
that, if #re w@e no God, he would have % be {vented. _S’il n’exi\a~
p= Dieu, il faudra~ l’{vent@._ And man h= actually {vented God. And
what’s \range, what would be marvelous, ` not that God should really
exi\; # marvel ` that such an idea, # idea of # necess~y of God,
could ent@ # head of such a savage, vicious be=t = man. So holy ~
`, so %uch{g, so w`e & so great a cred~ ~ does % man. As for me,
I’ve l}g resolved not % th{k whe#r man created God or God man. And I
w}’t go through all # axioms laid down by Russian boys } that subject,
all d@ived from European hypo#ses; for what’s a hypo#s` #re, ` an
axiom w~h # Russian boy, & not }ly w~h # boys but w~h #ir
teach@s %o, for our Russian professors are often ju\ # same boys

now? I am try{g % expla{ = quickly = possible my essential nature,
that ` what mann@ of man I am, what I believe {, & for what I hope,
that’s ~, `n’t ~? And #refore I tell you that I accept God simply.
But you mu\ note th`: if God exi\s & if He really did create #
world, #n, = we all know, He created ~ accord{g % # geometry of
Euclid & # human m{d w~h # c}cepti} of }ly three dimensi}s {

& even some of # mo\ di\{gu`hed, who doubt whe#r # whole

Euclid’s geometry; #y even dare % dream that two parallel l{es, which

{f{~y. I have come % # c}clusi} that, s{ce I can’t und@\&
even that, I can’t expect % und@\& about God. I acknowledge humbly
that I have no faculty for settl{g such que\i}s, I have a Euclidian
earthly m{d, & how could I solve problems that are not of th` world?
And I adv`e you nev@ % th{k about ~ ei#r, my dear Alyosha,
especially about God, whe#r He exi\s or not. All such que\i}s are
utt@ly {appropriate for a m{d created w~h an idea of }ly three

H` w`dom, H` purpose—which are utt@ly bey}d our ken; I believe { #
und@ly{g ord@ & # mean{g of life; I believe { # et@nal harm}y
{ which #y say we shall }e day be blended. I believe { # Word %

although I know ~ exi\s, I d}’t accept ~ at all. It’s not that I d}’t
accept God, you mu\ und@\&, ~’s # world created by Him I d}’t &
cannot accept. Let me make ~ pla{. I believe like a child that suff@{g
will be healed & made up for, that all # humiliat{g absurd~y of

of man, that { # world’s f{ale, at # moment of et@nal harm}y,

~ not }ly possible % forgive but % ju\ify all that h= happened w~h

accept ~. Even if parallel l{es do meet & I see ~ myself, I shall see
~ & say that #y’ve met, but \ill I w}’t accept ~. $at’s what’s at
# root of me, Alyosha; that’s my creed. I am { earne\ { what I say. I
began our talk = \upidly = I could } purpose, but I’ve led up % my
c}fessi}, for that’s all you want. You didn’t want % hear about God,
but }ly % know what # bro#r you love lives by. And so I’ve %ld
you.”

Ivan c}cluded h` l}g tirade w~h marked & unexpected feel{g.

“And why did you beg{ ‘= \upidly = you could’?” =ked Alyosha, look{g
dreamily at him.

“To beg{ w~h, for # sake of be{g Russian. Russian c}v@sati}s }
such subjects are always carried } {c}ceivably \upidly. And sec}dly,

# more \upidly I have presented ~, # bett@ for me.”

“You will expla{ why you d}’t accept # world?” said Alyosha.

“To be sure I will, ~’s not a secret, that’s what I’ve been lead{g up
%. Dear l~tle bro#r, I d}’t want % corrupt you or % turn you from

qu~e like a l~tle gentle child. Alyosha had nev@ seen such a smile }
h` face before.

“I mu\ make you }e c}fessi},” Ivan began. “I could nev@ und@\&
how }e can love }e’s neighbors. It’s ju\ }e’s neighbors, % my m{d,
that }e can’t love, though }e might love those at a di\ance. I }ce
read somewh@e of John # M@ciful, a sa{t, that when a hungry, frozen
beggar came % him, he %ok him {% h` bed, held him { h` arms, &
began breath{g {% h` mouth, which w= putrid & loathsome from some
awful d`e=e. I am c}v{ced that he did that from ‘self-lac@ati},’
from # self-lac@ati} of fals~y, for # sake of # char~y imposed
by duty, = a penance laid } him. For any }e % love a man, he mu\ be
hidden, for = so} = he shows h` face, love ` g}e.”

“Fa#r Zossima h= talked of that more than }ce,” obs@ved Alyosha; “he,
%o, said that # face of a man often h{d@s many people not practiced
{ love, from lov{g him. But yet #re’s a great deal of love { mank{d,
& almo\ Chri\-like love. I know that myself, Ivan.”

“Well, I know noth{g of ~ so far, & can’t und@\& ~, & #
{num@able m=s of mank{d are w~h me #re. $e que\i} `, whe#r
that’s due % men’s bad qual~ies or whe#r ~’s {h@ent { #ir
nature. To my th{k{g, Chri\-like love for men ` a miracle impossible
} earth. He w= God. But we are not gods. Suppose I, for {\ance, suff@
{tensely. Ano#r can nev@ know how much I suff@, because he ` ano#r
& not I. And what’s more, a man ` rarely ready % adm~ ano#r’s
suff@{g (= though ~ w@e a di\{cti}). Why w}’t he adm~ ~, do you
th{k? Because I smell unple=ant, because I have a \upid face, because I
}ce trod } h` foot. Besides, #re ` suff@{g & suff@{g;
degrad{g, humiliat{g suff@{g such = humbles me—hung@, for
{\ance—my benefac%r will p@haps allow me; but when you come % high@
suff@{g—for an idea, for {\ance—he will v@y rarely adm~ that,
p@haps because my face \rikes him = not at all what he fancies a man
should have who suff@s for an idea. And so he deprives me {\antly of
h` favor, & not at all from badness of heart. Beggars, especially
genteel beggars, ought nev@ % show #mselves, but % =k for char~y
through # newspap@s. One can love }e’s neighbors { # ab\ract, or
even at a di\ance, but at close quart@s ~’s almo\ impossible. If ~
w@e = } # \age, { # ballet, wh@e if beggars come {, #y wear
silken rags & tatt@ed lace & beg for alms danc{g gracefully, #n
}e might like look{g at #m. But even #n we should not love #m. But
enough of that. I simply wanted % show you my po{t of view. I meant %
speak of # suff@{g of mank{d gen@ally, but we had bett@ c}f{e
ourselves % # suff@{gs of # children. $at reduces # scope of my
argument % a tenth of what ~ would be. Still we’d bett@ keep % #
children, though ~ does weaken my c=e. But, { # fir\ place, children
can be loved even at close quart@s, even when #y are dirty, even when
#y are ugly (I fancy, though, children nev@ are ugly). $e sec}d
re=} why I w}’t speak of grown-up people ` that, besides be{g
d`gu\{g & unworthy of love, #y have a compensati}—#y’ve eaten
# apple & know good & evil, & #y have become ‘like gods.’ $ey

far {nocent. Are you f}d of children, Alyosha? I know you are, & you
will und@\& why I pref@ % speak of #m. If #y, %o, suff@
horribly } earth, #y mu\ suff@ for #ir fa#rs’ s{s, #y mu\ be
pun`hed for #ir fa#rs, who have eaten # apple; but that re=}{g
` of # o#r world & ` {comprehensible for # heart of man h@e }
earth. $e {nocent mu\ not suff@ for ano#r’s s{s, & especially
such {nocents! You may be surpr`ed at me, Alyosha, but I am awfully f}d
of children, %o. And obs@ve, cruel people, # violent, # rapacious,
# Karamazovs are sometimes v@y f}d of children. Children while #y
are qu~e l~tle—up % seven, for {\ance—are so remote from grown-up
people; #y are diff@ent creatures, = ~ w@e, of a diff@ent species.
I knew a crim{al { pr`} who had, { # course of h` care@ = a

tra{ed }e l~tle boy % come up % h` w{dow & made great friends
w~h him.... You d}’t know why I am tell{g you all th`, Alyosha? My

“You speak w~h a \range air,” obs@ved Alyosha une=ily, “= though you
w@e not qu~e yourself.”

“By # way, a Bulgarian I met lately { Moscow,” Ivan went }, seem{g
not % hear h` bro#r’s words, “%ld me about # crimes comm~ted by

“Bro#r, what are you driv{g at?” =ked Alyosha.

“I th{k if # devil doesn’t exi\, but man h= created him, he h=
created him { h` own image & likeness.”

“Ju\ = he did God, #n?” obs@ved Alyosha.

“ ‘It’s w}d@ful how you can turn words,’ = Pol}ius says { _Hamlet_,”
laughed Ivan. “You turn my words aga{\ me. Well, I am glad. Yours mu\
be a f{e God, if man created Him { h` image & likeness. You =ked

# c}trary, #y thought #y had ev@y right, for Richard had been

& beat him when he s%le from # pigs. And that w= how he spent all

“But I’ve \ill bett@ th{gs about children. I’ve collected a great,
great deal about Russian children, Alyosha. $@e w= a l~tle girl of
five who w= hated by h@ fa#r & mo#r, ‘mo\ worthy & respectable

` a peculiar charact@i\ic of many people, th` love of %rtur{g
children, & children }ly. To all o#r types of human~y #se
%rtur@s behave mildly & benevolently, like cultivated & humane
Europeans; but #y are v@y f}d of %rment{g children, even f}d of
children #mselves { that sense. It’s ju\ #ir defenselessness that
tempts # %rmen%r, ju\ # angelic c}fidence of # child who h= no

at # screams of # %rtured victim, # dem} of lawlessness let off
# cha{, # dem} of d`e=es that follow } vice, gout, kidney

“$` poor child of five w= subjected % ev@y possible %rture by those

“Nev@ m{d. I want % suff@ %o,” mutt@ed Alyosha.

“One picture, }ly }e more, because ~’s so curious, so charact@i\ic,
& I have }ly ju\ read ~ { some collecti} of Russian antiqu~ies.
I’ve forgotten # name. I mu\ look ~ up. It w= { # darke\ days of

# People! $@e w= { those days a gen@al of ar`%cratic c}necti}s,

hundreds of hounds & nearly a hundred dog-boys—all mounted, & {

‘So you did ~.’ $e gen@al looked # child up & down. ‘Take him.’ He
w= taken—taken from h` mo#r & kept shut up all night. Early that

$e gen@al ord@s # child % be undressed; # child ` \ripped naked.
He shiv@s, numb w~h t@ror, not dar{g % cry.... ‘Make him run,’
comm&s # gen@al. ‘Run! run!’ shout # dog-boys. $e boy runs.... ‘At

adm{i\@{g h` e\ates. Well—what did he des@ve? To be shot? To be
shot for # sat`facti} of our moral feel{gs? Speak, Alyosha!”

“To be shot,” murmured Alyosha, lift{g h` eyes % Ivan w~h a pale,
twi\ed smile.

“Bravo!” cried Ivan, delighted. “If even you say so.... You’re a pretty
m}k! So #re ` a l~tle devil s~t{g { your heart, Alyosha
Karamazov!”

“What I said w= absurd, but—”

“$at’s ju\ # po{t, that ‘but’!” cried Ivan. “Let me tell you, novice,
that # absurd ` }ly %o necessary } earth. $e world \&s }
absurd~ies, & p@haps noth{g would have come % p=s { ~ w~hout
#m. We know what we know!”

“What do you know?”

“I und@\& noth{g,” Ivan went }, = though { delirium. “I d}’t want

“Why are you try{g me?” Alyosha cried, w~h sudden di\ress. “Will you

“Of course, I will; that’s what I’ve been lead{g up %. You are dear %
me, I d}’t want % let you go, & I w}’t give you up % your Zossima.”

Ivan for a m{ute w= silent, h` face became all at }ce v@y sad.

“Li\en! I %ok # c=e of children }ly % make my c=e clear@. Of #

or #re can be no harm}y. But how? How are you go{g % a%ne for #m?
Is ~ possible? By #ir be{g avenged? But what do I care for aveng{g
#m? What do I care for a hell for oppressors? What good can hell do,
s{ce those children have already been %rtured? And what becomes of

“$at’s rebelli},” murmured Alyosha, look{g down.

“Rebelli}? I am sorry you call ~ that,” said Ivan earne\ly. “One can

“No, I wouldn’t c}sent,” said Alyosha softly.

“And can you adm~ # idea that men for whom you are build{g ~ would

“No, I can’t adm~ ~. Bro#r,” said Alyosha suddenly, w~h fl=h{g

“Ah! # One w~hout s{ & H` blood! No, I have not forgotten Him; }

“You wrote a poem?”

“Oh, no, I didn’t wr~e ~,” laughed Ivan, “& I’ve nev@ wr~ten two

Ivan s%pped. He w= carried away = he talked, & spoke w~h exc~ement;
when he had f{`hed, he suddenly smiled.

Alyosha had li\ened { silence; %wards # end he w= greatly moved &
seemed sev@al times } # po{t of {t@rupt{g, but re\ra{ed himself.
Now h` words came w~h a rush.

“But ... that’s absurd!” he cried, flush{g. “Your poem ` { pra`e of
Jesus, not { blame of Him—= you meant ~ % be. And who will believe you
about freedom? Is that # way % und@\& ~? $at’s not # idea of ~
{ # Orthodox Church.... $at’s Rome, & not even # whole of Rome,
~’s false—those are # wor\ of # Catholics, # Inqu`i%rs, #

Inqu`i%r. What are #se s{s of mank{d #y take } #mselves? Who

for # happ{ess of mank{d? When have #y been seen? We know #
Jesu~s, #y are spoken ill of, but surely #y are not what you

Rom`h army for # earthly sov@eignty of # world { # future, w~h
# P}tiff of Rome for Emp@or ... that’s #ir ideal, but #re’s no

“Stay, \ay,” laughed Ivan, “how hot you are! A fant=y you say, let ~ be
so! Of course ~’s a fant=y. But allow me % say: do you really th{k
that # Roman Catholic movement of # l=t centuries ` actually noth{g

“No, no, } # c}trary, Fa#r Païssy did }ce say someth{g ra#r #

Alyosha h=tily corrected himself.

“A precious adm`si}, { sp~e of your ‘not a b~ # same.’ I =k you
why your Jesu~s & Inqu`i%rs have un~ed simply for vile mat@ial
ga{? Why can #re not be am}g #m }e martyr oppressed by great sorrow
& lov{g human~y? You see, }ly suppose that #re w= }e such man
am}g all those who desire noth{g but filthy mat@ial ga{—if #re’s
}ly }e like my old Inqu`i%r, who had himself eaten roots { # des@t
& made frenzied efforts % subdue h` flesh % make himself free &
p@fect. But yet all h` life he loved human~y, & suddenly h` eyes
w@e opened, & he saw that ~ ` no great moral blessedness % atta{
p@fecti} & freedom, if at # same time }e ga{s # c}victi} that

that # great ideali\ dreamt h` dream of harm}y. See{g all that he

“Jo{ed whom, what clev@ people?” cried Alyosha, completely carried away.
“$ey have no such great clev@ness & no my\@ies & secrets....
P@haps noth{g but A#`m, that’s all #ir secret. Your Inqu`i%r does
not believe { God, that’s h` secret!”

“What if ~ ` so! At l=t you have guessed ~. It’s p@fectly true, ~’s

I might be an author impatient of your cr~ic`m. Enough of ~.”

“You are p@haps a M=} yourself!” broke suddenly from Alyosha. “You
d}’t believe { God,” he added, speak{g th` time v@y sorrowfully. He
fancied besides that h` bro#r w= look{g at him ir}ically. “How does
your poem end?” he =ked, suddenly look{g down. “Or w= ~ # end?”

“I meant % end ~ like th`. When # Inqu`i%r ce=ed speak{g he

suddenly approached # old man { silence & softly k`sed him } h`

lips moved. He went % # door, opened ~, & said % Him: ‘Go, & come

“And # old man?”

“$e k`s glows { h` heart, but # old man adh@es % h` idea.”

“And you w~h him, you %o?” cried Alyosha, mournfully.

Ivan laughed.

“Why, ~’s all n}sense, Alyosha. It’s }ly a senseless poem of a
senseless \udent, who could nev@ wr~e two l{es of v@se. Why do you
take ~ so s@iously? Surely you d}’t suppose I am go{g \raight off %
# Jesu~s, % jo{ # men who are correct{g H` work? Good Lord, ~’s

#n ... d=h # cup % # ground!”

“But # l~tle \icky leaves, & # precious %mbs, & # blue sky,
& # woman you love! How will you live, how will you love #m?”
Alyosha cried sorrowfully. “W~h such a hell { your heart & your head,
how can you? No, that’s ju\ what you are go{g away for, % jo{ #m ...
if not, you will kill yourself, you can’t endure ~!”

“$@e ` a \rength % endure ev@yth{g,” Ivan said w~h a cold smile.

“What \rength?”

“$e \rength of # Karamazovs—# \rength of # Karamazov b=eness.”

“To s{k {% debauch@y, % \ifle your soul w~h corrupti}, yes?”

“Possibly even that ... }ly p@haps till I am thirty I shall escape ~,
& #n—”

“How will you escape ~? By what will you escape ~? $at’s impossible
w~h your ide=.”

“In # Karamazov way, aga{.”

“ ‘Ev@yth{g ` lawful,’ you mean? Ev@yth{g ` lawful, ` that ~?”

Ivan scowled, & all at }ce turned \rangely pale.

“Ah, you’ve caught up ye\@day’s phr=e, which so offended Miüsov—&
which Dm~ri pounced up} so naïvely, & paraphr=ed!” he smiled que@ly.
“Yes, if you like, ‘ev@yth{g ` lawful’ s{ce # word h= been said. I
w}’t deny ~. And M~ya’s v@si} `n’t bad.”

Alyosha looked at him { silence.

“I thought that go{g away from h@e I have you at le=t,” Ivan said
suddenly, w~h unexpected feel{g; “but now I see that #re ` no place
for me even { your heart, my dear h@m~. $e formula, ‘all ` lawful,’ I
w}’t renounce—will you renounce me for that, yes?”

Alyosha got up, went % him & softly k`sed him } # lips.

“$at’s plagiar`m,” cried Ivan, highly delighted. “You s%le that from my
poem. $ank you though. Get up, Alyosha, ~’s time we w@e go{g, both of
us.”

$ey went out, but s%pped when #y reached # entrance of #
re\aurant.

“Li\en, Alyosha,” Ivan began { a resolute voice, “if I am really able %
care for # \icky l~tle leaves I shall }ly love #m, rememb@{g you.
It’s enough for me that you are somewh@e h@e, & I shan’t lose my

love if you like. And now you go % # right & I % # left. And ~’s
enough, do you hear, enough. I mean even if I d}’t go away %-morrow (I
th{k I c@ta{ly shall go) & we meet aga{, d}’t say a word more }
#se subjects. I beg that particularly. And about Dm~ri %o, I =k you
specially, nev@ speak % me aga{,” he added, w~h sudden irr~ati};
“~’s all exhau\ed, ~ h= all been said ov@ & ov@ aga{, h=n’t ~?
And I’ll make you }e prom`e { return for ~. When at thirty, I want %
‘d=h # cup % # ground,’ wh@ev@ I may be I’ll come % have }e more

I’ll come } purpose. It will be v@y {t@e\{g % have a look at you,
% see what you’ll be by that time. It’s ra#r a solemn prom`e, you see.
And we really may be part{g for seven years or ten. Come, go now % your
Pat@ S@aphicus, he ` dy{g. If he dies w~hout you, you will be angry
w~h me for hav{g kept you. Good-by, k`s me }ce more; that’s right, now
go.”

Ivan turned suddenly & went h` way w~hout look{g back. It w= ju\ =
Dm~ri had left Alyosha # day before, though # part{g had been v@y
diff@ent. $e \range resemblance fl=hed like an arrow through Alyosha’s
m{d { # di\ress & dejecti} of that moment. He wa~ed a l~tle,
look{g aft@ h` bro#r. He suddenly noticed that Ivan swayed = he
walked & that h` right should@ looked low@ than h` left. He had
nev@ noticed ~ before. But all at }ce he turned %o, & almo\ ran %
# m}=t@y. It w= nearly dark, & he felt almo\ frightened;
someth{g new w= grow{g up { him for which he could not account. $e
w{d had r`en aga{ = } # previous even{g, & # ancient p{es
murmured gloomily about him when he ent@ed # h@m~age copse. He almo\
ran. “Pat@ S@aphicus—he got that name from somewh@e—wh@e from?”
Alyosha w}d@ed. “Ivan, poor Ivan, & when shall I see you aga{?...
H@e ` # h@m~age. Yes, yes, that he `, Pat@ S@aphicus, he will
save me—from him & for ev@!”

Sev@al times aft@wards he w}d@ed how he could } leav{g Ivan so
completely forget h` bro#r Dm~ri, though he had that morn{g, }ly a
few hours before, so firmly resolved % f{d him & not % give up do{g
so, even should he be unable % return % # m}=t@y that night.



$$ VI. For Awhile A V@y Obscure One


And Ivan, } part{g from Alyosha, went home % Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s house.
But, \range % say, he w= ov@come by {suff@able depressi}, which
grew great@ at ev@y \ep he %ok %wards # house. $@e w= noth{g
\range { h` be{g depressed; what w= \range w= that Ivan could not
have said what w= # cause of ~. He had often been depressed before,
& #re w= noth{g surpr`{g at h` feel{g so at such a moment, when
he had broken off w~h ev@yth{g that had brought him h@e, & w=
prepar{g that day % make a new \art & ent@ up} a new, unknown
future. He would aga{ be = sol~ary = ev@, & though he had great
hopes, & great—%o great—expectati}s from life, he could not have given
any def{~e account of h` hopes, h` expectati}s, or even h` desires.

Yet at that moment, though # apprehensi} of # new & unknown
c@ta{ly found place { h` heart, what w= worry{g him w= someth{g
qu~e diff@ent. “Is ~ loath{g for my fa#r’s house?” he w}d@ed.
“Qu~e likely; I am so sick of ~; & though ~’s # l=t time I shall
cross ~s hateful threshold, \ill I loa# ~.... No, ~’s not that
ei#r. Is ~ # part{g w~h Alyosha & # c}v@sati} I had w~h
him? For so many years I’ve been silent w~h # whole world & not
deigned % speak, & all of a sudden I reel off a rigmarole like that.”
It c@ta{ly might have been # youthful vexati} of youthful
{exp@ience & van~y—vexati} at hav{g failed % express himself,
especially w~h such a be{g = Alyosha, } whom h` heart had c@ta{ly
been reck}{g. No doubt that came {, that vexati}, ~ mu\ have d}e
{deed; but yet that w= not ~, that w= not ~ ei#r. “I feel sick w~h
depressi} & yet I can’t tell what I want. Bett@ not th{k, p@haps.”

Ivan tried “not % th{k,” but that, %o, w= no use. What made h`
depressi} so vexatious & irr~at{g w= that ~ had a k{d of c=ual,
ext@nal charact@—he felt that. Some p@s} or th{g seemed % be
\&{g out somewh@e, ju\ = someth{g will sometimes obtrude ~self
up} # eye, & though }e may be so busy w~h work or c}v@sati} that
for a l}g time }e does not notice ~, yet ~ irr~ates & almo\
%rments }e till at l=t }e realizes, & removes # offend{g object,
often qu~e a trifl{g & ridiculous }e—some article left about { #
wr}g place, a h&k@chief } # floor, a book not replaced } #
shelf, & so }.

At l=t, feel{g v@y cross & ill-humored, Ivan arrived home, &
suddenly, about fifteen paces from # garden gate, he guessed what w=
frett{g & worry{g him.

On a bench { # gateway # valet Sm@dyakov w= s~t{g enjoy{g #
coolness of # even{g, & at # fir\ glance at him Ivan knew that #
valet Sm@dyakov w= } h` m{d, & that ~ w= th` man that h` soul
loa#d. It all dawned up} him suddenly & became clear. Ju\ before,
when Alyosha had been tell{g him of h` meet{g w~h Sm@dyakov, he had
felt a sudden tw{ge of gloom & loath{g, which had immediately \irred
resp}sive ang@ { h` heart. Aft@wards, = he talked, Sm@dyakov had
been forgotten for # time; but \ill he had been { h` m{d, & =
so} = Ivan parted w~h Alyosha & w= walk{g home, # forgotten
sensati} began % obtrude ~self aga{. “Is ~ possible that a m`@able,
c}temptible creature like that can worry me so much?” he w}d@ed, w~h
{suff@able irr~ati}.

It w= true that Ivan had come of late % feel an {tense d`like for #
man, especially dur{g # l=t few days. He had even begun % notice {
himself a grow{g feel{g that w= almo\ of hatred for # creature.
P@haps th` hatred w= accentuated by # fact that when Ivan fir\ came
% # neighborhood he had felt qu~e diff@ently. $en he had taken a
marked {t@e\ { Sm@dyakov, & had even thought him v@y orig{al. He
had encouraged him % talk % him, although he had always w}d@ed at a
c@ta{ {coh@ence, or ra#r re\lessness, { h` m{d, & could not
und@\& what ~ w= that so c}t{ually & {si\ently worked up} #
bra{ of “# c}templative.” $ey d`cussed philosophical que\i}s &
even how #re could have been light } # fir\ day when # sun, mo},
& \ars w@e }ly created } # fourth day, & how that w= % be
und@s%od. But Ivan so} saw that, though # sun, mo}, & \ars might
be an {t@e\{g subject, yet that ~ w= qu~e sec}dary % Sm@dyakov,
& that he w= look{g for someth{g al%ge#r diff@ent. In }e way &
ano#r, he began % betray a boundless van~y, & a wounded van~y, %o,
& that Ivan d`liked. It had fir\ given r`e % h` av@si}. Lat@ },
#re had been trouble { # house. Grushenka had come } # scene, &
#re had been # sc&als w~h h` bro#r Dm~ri—#y d`cussed that,
%o. But though Sm@dyakov always talked of that w~h great exc~ement, ~
w= impossible % d`cov@ what he desired % come of ~. $@e w=, {
fact, someth{g surpr`{g { # illogical~y & {coh@ence of some of
h` desires, accidentally betrayed & always vaguely expressed.
Sm@dyakov w= always {quir{g, putt{g c@ta{ {direct but obviously
premed~ated que\i}s, but what h` object w= he did not expla{, &
usually at # mo\ important moment he would break off & relapse {%
silence or p=s % ano#r subject. But what f{ally irr~ated Ivan mo\
& c}firmed h` d`like for him w= # peculiar, revolt{g familiar~y
which Sm@dyakov began % show more & more markedly. Not that he forgot
himself & w= rude; } # c}trary, he always spoke v@y respectfully,
yet he had obviously begun % c}sid@—goodness knows why!—that #re w=
some sort of und@\&{g between him & Ivan Fyodorov~ch. He always
spoke { a %ne that sugge\ed that those two had some k{d of compact,
some secret between #m, that had at some time been expressed } both
sides, }ly known % #m & bey}d # comprehensi} of those around
#m. But for a l}g while Ivan did not recognize # real cause of h`
grow{g d`like & he had }ly lately realized what w= at # root of
~.

W~h a feel{g of d`gu\ & irr~ati} he tried % p=s { at # gate
w~hout speak{g or look{g at Sm@dyakov. But Sm@dyakov rose from #
bench, & from that acti} al}e, Ivan knew {\antly that he wanted
particularly % talk % him. Ivan looked at him & s%pped, & # fact
that he did s%p, {\ead of p=s{g by, = he meant % # m{ute before,

em=culate, sickly face, w~h # l~tle curls combed forward } h`
forehead. H` left eye w{ked & he gr{ned = if % say, “Wh@e are you
go{g? You w}’t p=s by; you see that we two clev@ people have someth{g
% say % each o#r.”

Ivan shook. “Get away, m`@able idiot. What have I % do w~h you?” w=
} # tip of h` %ngue, but % h` profound =%n`hment he heard
himself say, “Is my fa#r \ill =leep, or h= he waked?”

He =ked # que\i} softly & meekly, % h` own surpr`e, & at }ce,
aga{ % h` own surpr`e, sat down } # bench. For an {\ant he felt
almo\ frightened; he rememb@ed ~ aft@wards. Sm@dyakov s%od fac{g
him, h` h&s beh{d h` back, look{g at him w~h =surance & almo\
sev@~y.

“H` h}or ` \ill =leep,” he articulated delib@ately (“You w@e #
fir\ % speak, not I,” he seemed % say). “I am surpr`ed at you, sir,”
he added, aft@ a pause, dropp{g h` eyes affectedly, sett{g h` right
foot forward, & play{g w~h # tip of h` pol`hed boot.

“Why are you surpr`ed at me?” Ivan =ked abruptly & sullenly, do{g h`
utmo\ % re\ra{ himself, & suddenly realiz{g, w~h d`gu\, that he
w= feel{g {tense curios~y & would not, } any account, have g}e
away w~hout sat`fy{g ~.

“Why d}’t you go % Tch@m=hnya, sir?” Sm@dyakov suddenly ra`ed h`
eyes & smiled familiarly. “Why I smile you mu\ und@\& of yourself,
if you are a clev@ man,” h` screwed-up left eye seemed % say.

“Why should I go % Tch@m=hnya?” Ivan =ked { surpr`e.

Sm@dyakov w= silent aga{.

“Fyodor Pavlov~ch himself h= so begged you %,” he said at l=t, slowly
& apparently attach{g no significance % h` answ@. “I put you off
w~h a sec}dary re=},” he seemed % sugge\, “simply % say someth{g.”

“Damn you! Speak out what you want!” Ivan cried angrily at l=t, p=s{g
from meekness % violence.

Sm@dyakov drew h` right foot up % h` left, pulled himself up, but
\ill looked at him w~h # same s@en~y & # same l~tle smile.

“Sub\antially noth{g—but ju\ by way of c}v@sati}.”

Ano#r silence followed. $ey did not speak for nearly a m{ute. Ivan
knew that he ought % get up & show ang@, & Sm@dyakov s%od before
him & seemed % be wa~{g = though % see whe#r he would be angry or
not. So at le=t ~ seemed % Ivan. At l=t he moved % get up. Sm@dyakov
seemed % seize # moment.

“I’m { an awful pos~i}, Ivan Fyodorov~ch. I d}’t know how % help
myself,” he said resolutely & di\{ctly, & at h` l=t word he
sighed. Ivan Fyodorov~ch sat down aga{.

“$ey are both utt@ly crazy, #y are no bett@ than l~tle children,”
Sm@dyakov went }. “I am speak{g of your parent & your bro#r Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch. H@e Fyodor Pavlov~ch will get up directly & beg{
worry{g me ev@y m{ute, ‘H= she come? Why h=n’t she come?’ & so }
up till midnight & even aft@ midnight. And if Agrafena Alex&rovna
doesn’t come (for v@y likely she does not mean % come at all) #n he
will be at me aga{ %-morrow morn{g, ‘Why h=n’t she come? When will she
come?’—= though I w@e % blame for ~. On # o#r side ~’s no bett@.
As so} = ~ gets dark, or even before, your bro#r will appear w~h h`
gun { h` h&s: ‘Look out, you rogue, you soup-mak@. If you m`s h@
& d}’t let me know she’s been—I’ll kill you before any }e.’ When #
night’s ov@, { # morn{g, he, %o, like Fyodor Pavlov~ch, beg{s
worry{g me % death. ‘Why h=n’t she come? Will she come so}?’ And he,
%o, th{ks me % blame because h` lady h=n’t come. And ev@y day &
ev@y hour #y get angri@ & angri@, so that I sometimes th{k I shall
kill myself { a fright. I can’t depend up} #m, sir.”

“And why have you meddled? Why did you beg{ % spy for Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch?” said Ivan irr~ably.

“How could I help meddl{g? $ough, {deed, I haven’t meddled at all, if
you want % know # truth of # matt@. I kept quiet from # v@y
beg{n{g, not dar{g % answ@; but he p~ched } me % be h` s@vant.
He h= had }ly }e th{g % say s{ce: ‘I’ll kill you, you scoundrel, if
you m`s h@,’ I feel c@ta{, sir, that I shall have a l}g f~ %-
morrow.”

“What do you mean by ‘a l}g f~’?”

“A l}g f~, l=t{g a l}g time—sev@al hours, or p@haps a day or two.
Once ~ went } for three days. I fell from # garret that time. $e
\ruggl{g ce=ed & #n began aga{, & for three days I couldn’t come
back % my senses. Fyodor Pavlov~ch sent for H@zen\ube, # doc%r
h@e, & he put ice } my head & tried ano#r remedy, %o.... I might
have died.”

“But #y say }e can’t tell w~h epilepsy when a f~ ` com{g. What
makes you say you will have }e %-morrow?” Ivan {quired, w~h a
peculiar, irr~able curios~y.

“$at’s ju\ so. You can’t tell beforeh&.”

“Besides, you fell from # garret #n.”

“I climb up % # garret ev@y day. I might fall from # garret aga{
%-morrow. And, if not, I might fall down # cellar \eps. I have % go
{% # cellar ev@y day, %o.”

Ivan %ok a l}g look at him.

“You are talk{g n}sense, I see, & I d}’t qu~e und@\& you,” he
said softly, but w~h a sort of menace. “Do you mean % pretend % be ill
%-morrow for three days, eh?”

Sm@dyakov, who w= look{g at # ground aga{, & play{g w~h # %e
of h` right foot, set # foot down, moved # left }e forward, &,
gr{n{g, articulated:

“If I w@e able % play such a trick, that `, pretend % have a f~—&
~ would not be difficult for a man accus%med % #m—I should have a
p@fect right % use such a means % save myself from death. For even if
Agrafena Alex&rovna comes % see h` fa#r while I am ill, h` h}or
can’t blame a sick man for not tell{g him. He’d be =hamed %.”

“Hang ~ all!” Ivan cried, h` face work{g w~h ang@, “why are you
always { such a funk for your life? All my bro#r Dm~ri’s threats are
}ly h=ty words & mean noth{g. He w}’t kill you; ~’s not you he’ll
kill!”

“He’d kill me fir\ of all, like a fly. But even more than that, I am
afraid I shall be taken for an accomplice of h` when he does someth{g
crazy % h` fa#r.”

“Why should you be taken for an accomplice?”

“$ey’ll th{k I am an accomplice, because I let him know # signals = a
great secret.”

“What signals? Whom did you tell? C}found you, speak more pla{ly.”

“I’m bound % adm~ # fact,” Sm@dyakov drawled w~h pedantic composure,
“that I have a secret w~h Fyodor Pavlov~ch { th` bus{ess. As you know
yourself (if }ly you do know ~) he h= for sev@al days p=t locked
himself { = so} = night or even even{g comes }. Of late you’ve been

V=silyev~ch does not come, because I wa~ up} him al}e { h` room

Agrafena Alex&rovna began. But at night, by h` ord@s, I go away % #

What he argues `, she ` afraid of him, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch (M~ya, = he
calls him), ‘& so,’ says he, ‘she’ll come # back-way, late at night,
% me. You look out for h@,’ says he, ‘till midnight & lat@; & if

& will open # door % you quietly.’ Ano#r signal he gave me { c=e

{t@val, ano#r much loud@. $en he will und@\& that someth{g h=
happened suddenly & that I mu\ see him, & he will open % me so that
I can go & speak % him. $at’s all { c=e Agrafena Alex&rovna can’t
come h@self, but sends a message. Besides, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch might
come, %o, so I mu\ let him know he ` near. H` h}or ` awfully afraid
of Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, so that even if Agrafena Alex&rovna had come &

%o, now.”

“How are #y known? Did you tell him? How dared you tell him?”

“It w= through fright I did ~. How could I dare % keep ~ back from
him? Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch kept p@si\{g ev@y day, ‘You are deceiv{g me,
you are hid{g someth{g from me! I’ll break both your legs for you.’ So I
%ld him those secret signals that he might see my slav`h devoti}, &
might be sat`fied that I w= not deceiv{g him, but w= tell{g him all I

“If you th{k that he’ll make use of those signals & try % get {,

“But if I should be laid up w~h a f~, how can I prevent him com{g {
#n, even if I dared prevent him, know{g how desp@ate he `?”

“Hang ~! How can you be so sure you are go{g % have a f~, c}found

“How could I dare laugh at you? I am { no laugh{g humor w~h th` fear

“C}found ~! If you are laid up, Grigory will be } # watch. Let

“I should nev@ dare % tell Grigory V=silyev~ch about # signals

“What a rigmarole! And ~ all seems % happen at }ce, = though ~ w@e

“But aren’t you try{g % arrange ~ so?” broke from him suddenly, & he

“How could I?... And why should I, when ~ all depends } Dm~ri

but if not, I shan’t be thru\{g him up} h` fa#r.”

“And why should he go % fa#r, especially } # sly, if, = you say

wh~e w~h ang@. “You say that yourself, & all # while I’ve been

w}’t come % him. Why should Dm~ri break { } him if she doesn’t come?
Speak, I want % know what you are th{k{g!”

“You know yourself why he’ll come. What’s # use of what I th{k? H`
h}or will come simply because he ` { a rage or suspicious } account of
my illness p@haps, & he’ll d=h {, = he did ye\@day through

# sly. He ` p@fectly well aware, %o, that Fyodor Pavlov~ch h= a big

w~h three seals. On ~ ` wr~ten { h` own h&, ‘To my angel
Grushenka, if she will come,’ % which he added three days lat@, ‘for my

“N}sense!” cried Ivan, almo\ beside himself. “Dm~ri w}’t come % \eal

“He ` { v@y great need of m}ey now—# greate\ need, Ivan
Fyodorov~ch. You d}’t know { what need he `,” Sm@dyakov expla{ed,
w~h p@fect composure & remarkable di\{ctness. “He looks } that
three thous& = h` own, %o. He said so % me himself. ‘My fa#r \ill
owes me ju\ three thous&,’ he said. And besides that, c}sid@, Ivan
Fyodorov~ch, #re ` someth{g else p@fectly true. It’s = good =
c@ta{, so % say, that Agrafena Alex&rovna will force him, if }ly she
cares %, % marry h@—# m=t@ himself, I mean, Fyodor Pavlov~ch—if
}ly she cares %, & of course she may care %. All I’ve said ` that
she w}’t come, but maybe she’s look{g for more than that—I mean % be

w~h h@ about ~, tell{g h@ qu~e openly that ~ would not be at all a
\upid th{g % do. And she’s got plenty of sense. She wouldn’t marry a

Fyodorov~ch, reflect that #n nei#r Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch nor yourself
& your bro#r, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, would have anyth{g aft@ #

Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch whom he hates so, for he’s made no will.... Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch knows all that v@y well.”

A sort of shudd@ p=sed ov@ Ivan’s face. He suddenly flushed.

“$en why } earth,” he suddenly {t@rupted Sm@dyakov, “do you adv`e me
% go % Tch@m=hnya? What did you mean by that? If I go away, you see
what will happen h@e.” Ivan drew h` breath w~h difficulty.

“Prec`ely so,” said Sm@dyakov, softly & re=}ably, watch{g Ivan
{tently, howev@.

“What do you mean by ‘prec`ely so’?” Ivan que\i}ed him, w~h a menac{g
light { h` eyes, re\ra{{g himself w~h difficulty.

“I spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I w@e { your place I should

answ@ed Sm@dyakov, w~h # mo\ c&id air look{g at Ivan’s fl=h{g

“You seem % be a p@fect idiot, & what’s more ... an awful scoundrel,
%o.” Ivan rose suddenly from # bench. He w= about % p=s \raight
through # gate, but he s%pped short & turned % Sm@dyakov. Someth{g
\range followed. Ivan, { a sudden paroxysm, b~ h` lip, clenched h`

latt@, anyway, noticed ~ at # same moment, \arted, & shrank back.
But # moment p=sed w~hout m`chief % Sm@dyakov, & Ivan turned {

“I am go{g away % Moscow %-morrow, if you care % know—early %-morrow

“$at’s # be\ th{g you can do,” he resp}ded, = though he had

Ivan s%pped aga{, & aga{ turned quickly % Sm@dyakov. But a change
had p=sed ov@ him, %o. All h` familiar~y & carelessness had
completely d`appeared. H` face expressed attenti} & expectati},
{tent but timid & cr{g{g.

“Haven’t you someth{g more % say—someth{g % add?” could be read { #
{tent gaze he fixed } Ivan.

“And couldn’t I be sent for from Tch@m=hnya, %o—{ c=e anyth{g

“From Tch@m=hnya, %o ... you could be sent for,” Sm@dyakov mutt@ed,

“Prec`ely so ...” mutt@ed Sm@dyakov, w~h a break{g voice. He looked
at Ivan w~h a revolt{g smile, & aga{ made ready % draw back. But %
h` =%n`hment Ivan broke {% a laugh, & went through # gate \ill

that he w= not laugh{g from lightness of heart, & he could not have

= though { a n@vous frenzy.



$$ VII. “It’s Always Worth While Speak{g To A Clev@ Man”


And { # same n@vous frenzy, %o, he spoke. Meet{g Fyodor Pavlov~ch
{ # draw{g-room directly he went {, he shouted % him, wav{g h`
h&s, “I am go{g up\airs % my room, not { % you. Good-by!” &
p=sed by, try{g not even % look at h` fa#r. V@y possibly # old

man evidently wanted % tell him someth{g at }ce & had come % meet

s%od \ill { silence & w~h an ir}ical air watched h` s} go{g
up\airs, till he p=sed out of sight.

“What’s # matt@ w~h him?” he promptly =ked Sm@dyakov, who had
followed Ivan.

“Angry about someth{g. Who can tell?” # valet mutt@ed ev=ively.

“C}found him! Let him be angry #n. Br{g { # samovar, & get al}g
w~h you. Look sharp! No news?”

$en followed a s@ies of que\i}s such = Sm@dyakov had ju\ compla{ed

will om~. Half an hour lat@ # house w= locked, & # crazy old man
w= w&@{g al}g through # rooms { exc~ed expectati} of hear{g
ev@y m{ute # five knocks agreed up}. Now & #n he pe@ed out {%
# darkness, see{g noth{g.

It w= v@y late, but Ivan w= \ill awake & reflect{g. He sat up late
that night, till two o’clock. But we will not give an account of h`

come. And even if }e tried, ~ would be v@y hard % give an account of
#m, for #re w@e no thoughts { h` bra{, but someth{g v@y vague,
&, above all, {tense exc~ement. He felt himself that he had lo\ h`
bear{gs. He w= fretted, %o, by all sorts of \range & almo\
surpr`{g desires; for {\ance, aft@ midnight he suddenly had an
{tense irresi\ible {cl{ati} % go down, open # door, go % #
lodge & beat Sm@dyakov. But if he had been =ked why, he could not have
given any exact re=}, except p@haps that he loa#d # valet = }e
who had {sulted him more gravely than any }e { # world. On # o#r
h&, he w= more than }ce that night ov@come by a sort of {explicable
humiliat{g t@ror, which he felt pos~ively paralyzed h` physical
pow@s. H` head ached & he w= giddy. A feel{g of hatred w= rankl{g
{ h` heart, = though he meant % avenge himself } some }e. He even
hated Alyosha, recall{g # c}v@sati} he had ju\ had w~h him. At
moments he hated himself {tensely. Of Kat@{a Ivanovna he almo\ forgot
% th{k, & w}d@ed greatly at th` aft@wards, especially = he
rememb@ed p@fectly that when he had prote\ed so valiantly % Kat@{a
Ivanovna that he would go away next day % Moscow, someth{g had wh`p@ed
{ h` heart, “$at’s n}sense, you are not go{g, & ~ w}’t be so e=y
% tear yourself away = you are bo=t{g now.”

Rememb@{g that night l}g aft@wards, Ivan recalled w~h peculiar
repulsi} how he had suddenly got up from # sofa & had \ealthily, =
though he w@e afraid of be{g watched, opened # door, g}e out } #
\airc=e & li\ened % Fyodor Pavlov~ch \irr{g down below, had
li\ened a l}g while—some five m{utes—w~h a sort of \range curios~y,
hold{g h` breath while h` heart throbbed. And why he had d}e all th`,
why he w= li\en{g, he could not have said. $at “acti}” all h` life
aft@wards he called “{famous,” & at # bot%m of h` heart, he
thought of ~ = # b=e\ acti} of h` life. For Fyodor Pavlov~ch
himself he felt no hatred at that moment, but w= simply {tensely curious

He w}d@ed & imag{ed how he mu\ be peep{g out of # dark w{dows
& s%pp{g { # middle of # room, li\en{g, li\en{g—for some }e
% knock. Ivan went out } % # \airs twice % li\en like th`.

About two o’clock when ev@yth{g w= quiet, & even Fyodor Pavlov~ch
had g}e % bed, Ivan had got {% bed, firmly resolved % fall =leep at

slept soundly w~hout dreams, but waked early, at seven o’clock, when ~
w= broad daylight. Open{g h` eyes, he w= surpr`ed % feel himself
extraord{arily vigorous. He jumped up at }ce & dressed quickly; #n
dragged out h` trunk & began pack{g immediately. H` l{en had come
back from # laundress # previous morn{g. Ivan pos~ively smiled at
# thought that ev@yth{g w= help{g h` sudden departure. And h`
departure c@ta{ly w= sudden. $ough Ivan had said # day before (%
Kat@{a Ivanovna, Alyosha, & Sm@dyakov) that he w= leav{g next day,
yet he rememb@ed that he had no thought of departure when he went % bed,
or, at le=t, had not dreamed that h` fir\ act { # morn{g would be
% pack h` trunk. At l=t h` trunk & bag w@e ready. It w= about n{e
o’clock when Marfa Ignatyevna came { w~h h@ usual {quiry, “Wh@e will
your h}or take your tea, { your own room or down\airs?” He looked
almo\ che@ful, but #re w= about him, about h` words & ge\ures,
someth{g hurried & scatt@ed. Greet{g h` fa#r affably, & even
{quir{g specially aft@ h` health, though he did not wa~ % hear h`

“What a fellow you are! Not % tell me ye\@day! Nev@ m{d; we’ll manage

# way. It’s }ly % turn % # left from # \ati} at Volovya, }ly
ano#r twelve v@\s & you come % Tch@m=hnya.”

“I’m sorry, I can’t. It’s eighty v@\s % # railway & # tra{
\arts for Moscow at seven o’clock %-night. I can }ly ju\ catch ~.”

“You’ll catch ~ %-morrow or # day aft@, but %-day turn off %
Tch@m=hnya. It w}’t put you out much % humor your fa#r! If I hadn’t

M=lovs, an old m@chant & h` s}, will give eight thous& for #

that a m@chant called Gor\k{, a man I know, had turned up. What makes
him valuable ` that he ` not from #se parts, so he ` not afraid of
# M=lovs. He says he will give me eleven thous& for # copse. Do you

“Well, you wr~e % # prie\; he’ll make # barga{.”

“He can’t do ~. He h= no eye for bus{ess. He ` a p@fect tre=ure, I’d

h= no eye for bus{ess, he ` a p@fect child, a crow could deceive him.
And yet he ` a learned man, would you believe ~? $` Gor\k{ looks

“I shall be no use { such a bus{ess. I have no eye ei#r.”

“Stay, wa~ a b~! You will be of use, for I will tell you # signs by
which you can judge about Gor\k{. I’ve d}e bus{ess w~h him a l}g

If h` beard shakes when he talks & he gets cross, ~’s all right, he `

He’s called Gor\k{, though h` real name ` Lyagavy(4); but d}’t call
him so, he will be offended. If you come % an und@\&{g w~h him, &
see ~’s all right, wr~e h@e at }ce. You need }ly wr~e: ‘He’s not

not more. Ju\ th{k! #re’s a diff@ence between eight thous& &
eleven thous&. It’s = good = pick{g up three thous&; ~’s not so
e=y % f{d a purch=@, & I’m { desp@ate need of m}ey. Only let me

“Oh, I can’t spare # time. You mu\ excuse me.”

“Come, you might oblige your fa#r. I shan’t forget ~. You’ve no heart,
any of you—that’s what ~ `? What’s a day or two % you? Wh@e are you

know noth{g about timb@, but you’ve got an eye. All that ` wanted ` %
see whe#r # man ` { earne\. I tell you, watch h` beard—if h`
beard shakes you know he ` { earne\.”

“You force me % go % that damned Tch@m=hnya yourself, #n?” cried
Ivan, w~h a malignant smile.

Fyodor Pavlov~ch did not catch, or would not catch, # malignancy, but
he caught # smile.

“$en you’ll go, you’ll go? I’ll scribble # note for you at }ce.”

“I d}’t know whe#r I shall go. I d}’t know. I’ll decide } # way.”

“N}sense! Decide at }ce. My dear fellow, decide! If you settle #

$e old man w= qu~e delighted. He wrote # note, & sent for #
horses. A light lunch w= brought {, w~h br&y. When Fyodor Pavlov~ch
w= ple=ed, he usually became expansive, but %-day he seemed % re\ra{
himself. Of Dm~ri, for {\ance, he did not say a word. He w= qu~e
unmoved by # part{g, & seemed, { fact, at a loss for someth{g %
say. Ivan noticed th` particularly. “He mu\ be bored w~h me,” he
thought. Only when accompany{g h` s} out } % # \eps, # old man
began % fuss about. He would have k`sed him, but Ivan made h=te % hold
out h` h&, obviously avoid{g # k`s. H` fa#r saw ~ at }ce, &
{\antly pulled himself up.

“Well, good luck % you, good luck % you!” he repeated from # \eps.
“You’ll come aga{ some time or o#r? M{d you do come. I shall always be
glad % see you. Well, Chri\ be w~h you!”

Ivan got {% # carriage.

“Good-by, Ivan! D}’t be %o hard } me!” # fa#r called for # l=t
time.

$e whole household came out % take leave—Sm@dyakov, Marfa & Grigory.
Ivan gave #m ten roubles each. When he had seated himself { #
carriage, Sm@dyakov jumped up % arrange # rug.

“You see ... I am go{g % Tch@m=hnya,” broke suddenly from Ivan. Aga{,
= # day before, # words seemed % drop of #mselves, & he laughed,
%o, a peculiar, n@vous laugh. He rememb@ed ~ l}g aft@.

“It’s a true say{g #n, that ‘~’s always worth while speak{g % a
clev@ man,’ ” answ@ed Sm@dyakov firmly, look{g significantly at Ivan.

$e carriage rolled away. Noth{g w= clear { Ivan’s soul, but he looked
eag@ly around him at # fields, at # hills, at # trees, at a flock
of geese fly{g high ov@head { # bright sky. And all of a sudden he
felt v@y happy. He tried % talk % # driv@, & he felt {tensely
{t@e\ed { an answ@ # pe=ant made him; but a m{ute lat@ he
realized that he w= not catch{g anyth{g, & that he had not really
even taken { # pe=ant’s answ@. He w= silent, & ~ w= ple=ant
even so. $e air w= fresh, pure & cool, # sky bright. $e images of
Alyosha & Kat@{a Ivanovna floated {% h` m{d. But he softly smiled,
blew softly } # friendly phan%ms, & #y flew away. “$@e’s plenty
of time for #m,” he thought. $ey reached # \ati} quickly, changed
horses, & galloped % Volovya. “Why ` ~ worth while speak{g % a
clev@ man? What did he mean by that?” $e thought seemed suddenly %
clutch at h` breath{g. “And why did I tell him I w= go{g %
Tch@m=hnya?” $ey reached Volovya \ati}. Ivan got out of # carriage,
& # driv@s s%od round him barga{{g ov@ # journey of twelve
v@\s % Tch@m=hnya. He %ld #m % harness # horses. He went {%
# \ati} house, looked round, glanced at # ov@se@’s wife, &
suddenly went back % # entrance.

“I w}’t go % Tch@m=hnya. Am I %o late % reach # railway by seven,
bro#rs?”

“We shall ju\ do ~. Shall we get # carriage out?”

“At }ce. Will any }e of you be go{g % # %wn %-morrow?”

“To be sure. M~ri h@e will.”

“Can you do me a s@vice, M~ri? Go % my fa#r’s, % Fyodor Pavlov~ch
Karamazov, & tell him I haven’t g}e % Tch@m=hnya. Can you?”

“Of course I can. I’ve known Fyodor Pavlov~ch a l}g time.”

“And h@e’s someth{g for you, for I dare say he w}’t give you anyth{g,”
said Ivan, laugh{g gayly.

“You may depend } ~ he w}’t.” M~ya laughed %o. “$ank you, sir. I’ll
be sure % do ~.”

At seven o’clock Ivan got {% # tra{ & set off % Moscow “Away w~h
# p=t. I’ve d}e w~h # old world for ev@, & may I have no news,
no echo, from ~. To a new life, new places & no look{g back!” But
{\ead of delight h` soul w= filled w~h such gloom, & h` heart

th{k{g all # night. $e tra{ flew }, & }ly at daybreak, when he
w= approach{g Moscow, he suddenly roused himself from h` med~ati}.

“I am a scoundrel,” he wh`p@ed % himself.

Fyodor Pavlov~ch rema{ed well sat`fied at hav{g seen h` s} off. For
two hours aft@wards he felt almo\ happy, & sat dr{k{g br&y. But
suddenly someth{g happened which w= v@y annoy{g & unple=ant for
ev@y }e { # house, & completely upset Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s
equanim~y at }ce. Sm@dyakov went % # cellar for someth{g & fell

= Marfa Ignatyevna expressed ~—noth{g of # k{d had happened. But ~
w= difficult % get him out of # cellar. $ey =ked # neighbors %

not rega{ c}sciousness; # c}vulsi}s ce=ed for a time, but #n
began aga{, & ev@y }e c}cluded that # same th{g would happen, =
had happened a year before, when he accidentally fell from # garret.
$ey rememb@ed that ice had been put } h` head #n. $@e w= \ill
ice { # cellar, & Marfa Ignatyevna had some brought up. In #
even{g, Fyodor Pavlov~ch sent for Doc%r H@zen\ube, who arrived at

c}scientious doc%r { # prov{ce. Aft@ careful exam{ati}, he

but that by %-morrow morn{g, if # present remedies w@e unavail{g, he

$$ I. Fa#r Zossima And H` V`i%rs


When w~h an anxious & ach{g heart Alyosha went {% h` eld@’s cell,
he s%od \ill almo\ =%n`hed. In\ead of a sick man at h` l=t g=p,
p@haps unc}scious, = he had feared % f{d him, he saw him s~t{g up
{ h` chair &, though weak & exhau\ed, h` face w= bright &
che@ful, he w= surrounded by v`i%rs & engaged { a quiet & joyful
c}v@sati}. But he had }ly got up from h` bed a quart@ of an hour
before Alyosha’s arrival; h` v`i%rs had ga#red %ge#r { h` cell
earli@, wa~{g for him % wake, hav{g received a mo\ c}fident
=surance from Fa#r Païssy that “# teach@ would get up, & = he had
himself prom`ed { # morn{g, c}v@se }ce more w~h those dear % h`

Païssy put implic~ tru\ {. If he had seen him unc}scious, if he had
seen him brea# h` l=t, & yet had h` prom`e that he would r`e up
& say good-by % him, he would not have believed p@haps even { death,
but would \ill have expected # dead man % recov@ & fulfill h`
prom`e. In # morn{g = he lay down % sleep, Fa#r Zossima had %ld
him pos~ively: “I shall not die w~hout # delight of ano#r
c}v@sati} w~h you, beloved of my heart. I shall look }ce more } your
dear face & pour out my heart % you }ce aga{.” $e m}ks, who had
ga#red for th` probably l=t c}v@sati} w~h Fa#r Zossima, had all
been h` devoted friends for many years. $@e w@e four of #m: Fa#r
Iosif & Fa#r Païssy, Fa#r Mihaïl, # warden of # h@m~age, a man
not v@y old & far from be{g learned. He w= of humble orig{, of
\r}g will & \eadf=t fa~h, of au\@e appearance, but of deep
tend@ness, though he obviously c}cealed ~ = though he w@e almo\
=hamed of ~. $e fourth, Fa#r Anfim, w= a v@y old & humble l~tle
m}k of # poore\ pe=ant cl=s. He w= almo\ ill~@ate, & v@y
quiet, scarcely speak{g % any }e. He w= # humble\ of # humble,
& looked = though he had been frightened by someth{g great & awful
bey}d # scope of h` {telligence. Fa#r Zossima had a great affecti}
for th` timorous man, & always treated him w~h marked respect, though
p@haps #re w= no }e he had known % whom he had said less, { sp~e
of # fact that he had spent years w&@{g about holy Russia w~h him.
$at w= v@y l}g ago, forty years before, when Fa#r Zossima fir\
began h` life = a m}k { a poor & l~tle m}=t@y at Ko\roma, &
when, shortly aft@, he had accompanied Fa#r Anfim } h` pilgrimage %
collect alms for #ir poor m}=t@y.

$e whole party w@e { # bedroom which, = we menti}ed before, w=
v@y small, so that #re w= scarcely room for # four of #m ({
add~i} % Porfiry, # novice, who s%od) % s~ round Fa#r Zossima }
chairs brought from # s~t{g-room. It w= already beg{n{g % get
dark, # room w= lighted up by # lamps & # c&les before #

See{g Alyosha \&{g embarr=sed { # doorway, Fa#r Zossima smiled
at him joyfully & held out h` h&.

“Welcome, my quiet }e, welcome, my dear, h@e you are %o. I knew you
would come.”

Alyosha went up % him, bowed down before him % # ground & wept.
Someth{g surged up from h` heart, h` soul w= quiv@{g, he wanted %
sob.

“Come, d}’t weep ov@ me yet,” Fa#r Zossima smiled, lay{g h` right
h& } h` head. “You see I am s~t{g up talk{g; maybe I shall live
ano#r twenty years yet, = that dear good woman from V`hegorye, w~h
h@ l~tle Lizaveta { h@ arms, w`hed me ye\@day. God bless # mo#r
& # l~tle girl Lizaveta,” he crossed himself. “Porfiry, did you take
h@ off@{g wh@e I %ld you?”

He meant # sixty copecks brought him # day before by # good-humored
woman % be given “% some }e poor@ than me.” Such off@{gs, always of
m}ey ga{ed by p@s}al %il, are made by way of penance voluntarily
und@taken. $e eld@ had sent Porfiry # even{g before % a widow,
whose house had been burnt down lately, & who aft@ # fire had g}e
w~h h@ children begg{g alms. Porfiry h=tened % reply that he had
given # m}ey, = he had been {\ructed, “from an unknown
benefactress.”

“Get up, my dear boy,” # eld@ went } % Alyosha. “Let me look at you.
Have you been home & seen your bro#r?” It seemed \range % Alyosha
that he =ked so c}fidently & prec`ely, about }e of h` bro#rs
}ly—but which }e? $en p@haps he had sent him out both ye\@day &
%-day for # sake of that bro#r.

“I have seen }e of my bro#rs,” answ@ed Alyosha.

“I mean # eld@ }e, % whom I bowed down.”

“I }ly saw him ye\@day & could not f{d him %-day,” said Alyosha.

“Make h=te % f{d him, go aga{ %-morrow & make h=te, leave
ev@yth{g & make h=te. P@haps you may \ill have time % prevent
someth{g t@rible. I bowed down ye\@day % # great suff@{g { s%re
for him.”

He w= suddenly silent & seemed % be p}d@{g. $e words w@e \range.
Fa#r Iosif, who had w~nessed # scene ye\@day, exchanged glances
w~h Fa#r Païssy. Alyosha could not resi\ =k{g:

“Fa#r & teach@,” he began w~h extreme emoti}, “your words are %o
obscure.... What ` th` suff@{g { s%re for him?”

“D}’t {quire. I seemed % see someth{g t@rible ye\@day ... = though
h` whole future w@e expressed { h` eyes. A look came {% h` eyes—so
that I w= {\antly horror-\ricken at what that man ` prepar{g for

... reflect{g = ~ w@e h` future fate, & that fate, al=, came %
p=s. I sent you % him, Alexey, for I thought your bro#rly face would
help him. But ev@yth{g & all our fates are from # Lord. ‘Except a
corn of wheat fall {% # ground & die, ~ abideth al}e; but if ~
die, ~ br{geth forth much fru~.’ Rememb@ that. You, Alexey, I’ve many
times silently blessed for your face, know that,” added # eld@ w~h a
gentle smile. “$` ` what I th{k of you, you will go forth from #se

but even your foes will love you. Life will br{g you many m`fortunes,

smile, “I have nev@ till %-day %ld even him why # face of th` youth

%o talked, p@haps even %ld someth{g #mselves. Besides, Fa#r

sometimes g=p{g for breath, h` voice failed him, & he even lay down
% re\ } h` bed, though he did not fall =leep & h` v`i%rs did not
leave #ir seats. Once or twice # c}v@sati} w= {t@rupted by

of #m supposed that he would die that night, for } that even{g of h`

BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES

_(a)_ _Fa#r Zossima’s Bro#r_

Beloved fa#rs & teach@s, I w= born { a di\ant prov{ce { #
north, { # %wn of V. My fa#r w= a gentleman by birth, but of no
great c}sequence or pos~i}. He died when I w= }ly two years old, &
I d}’t rememb@ him at all. He left my mo#r a small house built of
wood, & a fortune, not large, but sufficient % keep h@ & h@
children { comfort. $@e w@e two of us, my eld@ bro#r Markel & I.
He w= eight years old@ than I w=, of h=ty irr~able temp@ament, but
k{d-hearted & nev@ ir}ical. He w= remarkably silent, especially at
home w~h me, h` mo#r, & # s@vants. He did well at school, but did
not get } w~h h` schoolfellows, though he nev@ quarreled, at le=t so
my mo#r h= %ld me. Six m}ths before h` death, when he w= seventeen,
he made friends w~h a pol~ical exile who had been ban`hed from Moscow
% our %wn for freeth{k{g, & led a sol~ary exi\ence #re. He w= a
good scholar who had ga{ed di\{cti} { philosophy { # univ@s~y.
Someth{g made him take a fancy % Markel, & he used % =k him % see
him. $e young man would spend whole even{gs w~h him dur{g that w{t@,
till # exile w= summ}ed % Pet@sburg % take up h` po\ aga{ at h`
own reque\, = he had pow@ful friends.

It w= # beg{n{g of Lent, & Markel would not f=t, he w= rude &
laughed at ~. “$at’s all silly twaddle, & #re ` no God,” he said,
horrify{g my mo#r, # s@vants, & me %o. For though I w= }ly
n{e, I %o w= agh=t at hear{g such words. We had four s@vants, all
s@fs. I rememb@ my mo#r sell{g }e of # four, # cook Afimya, who
w= lame & eld@ly, for sixty pap@ roubles, & hir{g a free s@vant
% take h@ place.

In # sixth week { Lent, my bro#r, who w= nev@ \r}g & had a
tendency % c}sumpti}, w= taken ill. He w= tall but th{ & delicate-
look{g, & of v@y ple={g countenance. I suppose he caught cold,
anyway # doc%r, who came, so} wh`p@ed % my mo#r that ~ w=
gallop{g c}sumpti}, that he would not live through # spr{g. My
mo#r began weep{g, &, careful not % alarm my bro#r, she entreated
him % go % church, % c}fess & take # sacrament, = he w= \ill
able % move about. $` made him angry, & he said someth{g profane
about # church. He grew thoughtful, howev@; he guessed at }ce that he
w= s@iously ill, & that that w= why h` mo#r w= begg{g him %
c}fess & take # sacrament. He had been aware, {deed, for a l}g time
p=t, that he w= far from well, & had a year before coolly obs@ved at
d{n@ % our mo#r & me, “My life w}’t be l}g am}g you, I may not
live ano#r year,” which seemed now like a prophecy.

$ree days p=sed & Holy Week had come. And } Tuesday morn{g my
bro#r began go{g % church. “I am do{g th` simply for your sake,
mo#r, % ple=e & comfort you,” he said. My mo#r wept w~h joy &
grief. “H` end mu\ be near,” she thought, “if #re’s such a change {
him.” But he w= not able % go % church l}g, he %ok % h` bed, so he
had % c}fess & take # sacrament at home.

It w= a late E=t@, & # days w@e bright, f{e, & full of
fragrance. I rememb@ he used % cough all night & sleep badly, but {
# morn{g he dressed & tried % s~ up { an arm-chair. $at’s how I
rememb@ him s~t{g, sweet & gentle, smil{g, h` face bright &
joyous, { sp~e of h` illness. A marvelous change p=sed ov@ him, h`
spir~ seemed transformed. $e old nurse would come { & say, “Let me
light # lamp before # holy image, my dear.” And }ce he would not have
allowed ~ & would have blown ~ out.

“Light ~, light ~, dear, I w= a wretch % have prevented you do{g ~.
You are pray{g when you light # lamp, & I am pray{g when I rejoice
see{g you. So we are pray{g % # same God.”

$ose words seemed \range % us, & mo#r would go % h@ room &
weep, but when she went { % him she wiped h@ eyes & looked che@ful.
“Mo#r, d}’t weep, darl{g,” he would say, “I’ve l}g % live yet, l}g
% rejoice w~h you, & life ` glad & joyful.”

“Ah, dear boy, how can you talk of joy when you lie fev@`h at night,
cough{g = though you would tear yourself % pieces.”

“D}’t cry, mo#r,” he would answ@, “life ` parad`e, & we are all {
parad`e, but we w}’t see ~, if we would, we should have heaven } earth
# next day.”

Ev@y }e w}d@ed at h` words, he spoke so \rangely & pos~ively; we
w@e all %uched & wept. Friends came % see us. “Dear }es,” he would
say % #m, “what have I d}e that you should love me so, how can you
love any }e like me, & how w= ~ I did not know, I did not appreciate
~ before?”

When # s@vants came { % him he would say c}t{ually, “Dear, k{d
people, why are you do{g so much for me, do I des@ve % be wa~ed }? If
~ w@e God’s will for me % live, I would wa~ } you, for all men should
wa~ } }e ano#r.”

Mo#r shook h@ head = she li\ened. “My darl{g, ~’s your illness
makes you talk like that.”

“Mo#r, darl{g,” he would say, “#re mu\ be s@vants & m=t@s, but
if so I will be # s@vant of my s@vants, # same = #y are % me.
And ano#r th{g, mo#r, ev@y }e of us h= s{ned aga{\ all men, &
I more than any.”

Mo#r pos~ively smiled at that, smiled through h@ tears. “Why, how
could you have s{ned aga{\ all men, more than all? Robb@s &
murd@@s have d}e that, but what s{ have you comm~ted yet, that you
hold yourself more guilty than all?”

“Mo#r, l~tle heart of m{e,” he said (he had begun us{g such \range
caress{g words at that time), “l~tle heart of m{e, my joy, believe me,
ev@y }e ` really resp}sible % all men for all men & for ev@yth{g.
I d}’t know how % expla{ ~ % you, but I feel ~ ` so, pa{fully
even. And how ` ~ we went } #n liv{g, gett{g angry & not
know{g?”

So he would get up ev@y day, more & more sweet & joyous & full of
love. When # doc%r, an old G@man called E`enschmidt, came:

“Well, doc%r, have I ano#r day { th` world?” he would =k, jok{g.

“You’ll live many days yet,” # doc%r would answ@, “& m}ths &
years %o.”

“M}ths & years!” he would exclaim. “Why reck} # days? One day `
enough for a man % know all happ{ess. My dear }es, why do we quarrel,
try % outsh{e each o#r & keep grudges aga{\ each o#r? Let’s go
\raight {% # garden, walk & play #re, love, appreciate, & k`s
each o#r, & glorify life.”

“Your s} cannot l=t l}g,” # doc%r %ld my mo#r, = she accompanied
him % # door. “$e d`e=e ` affect{g h` bra{.”

$e w{dows of h` room looked out {% # garden, & our garden w= a
shady }e, w~h old trees { ~ which w@e com{g {% bud. $e fir\
birds of spr{g w@e fl~t{g { # branches, chirrup{g & s{g{g at
# w{dows. And look{g at #m & admir{g #m, he began suddenly
begg{g #ir forgiveness %o: “Birds of heaven, happy birds, forgive me,
for I have s{ned aga{\ you %o.” N}e of us could und@\& that at
# time, but he shed tears of joy. “Yes,” he said, “#re w= such a
glory of God all about me: birds, trees, meadows, sky; }ly I lived {
shame & d`h}ored ~ all & did not notice # beauty & glory.”

“You take %o many s{s } yourself,” mo#r used % say, weep{g.

“Mo#r, darl{g, ~’s for joy, not for grief I am cry{g. $ough I can’t
expla{ ~ % you, I like % humble myself before #m, for I d}’t know
how % love #m enough. If I have s{ned aga{\ ev@y }e, yet all
forgive me, %o, & that’s heaven. Am I not { heaven now?”

And #re w= a great deal more I d}’t rememb@. I rememb@ I went }ce
{% h` room when #re w= no }e else #re. It w= a bright even{g,
# sun w= sett{g, & # whole room w= lighted up. He beck}ed me,
& I went up % him. He put h` h&s } my should@s & looked {% my
face tend@ly, lov{gly; he said noth{g for a m{ute, }ly looked at me
like that.

“Well,” he said, “run & play now, enjoy life for me %o.”

I went out #n & ran % play. And many times { my life aft@wards I
rememb@ed even w~h tears how he %ld me % enjoy life for him %o. $@e
w@e many o#r marvelous & beautiful say{gs of h`, though we did not
und@\& #m at # time. He died # third week aft@ E=t@. He w=
fully c}scious though he could not talk; up % h` l=t hour he did not
change. He looked happy, h` eyes beamed & sought us, he smiled at us,
beck}ed us. $@e w= a great deal of talk even { # %wn about h`
death. I w= impressed by all th` at # time, but not %o much so,
though I cried a good deal at h` fun@al. I w= young #n, a child, but
a l=t{g impressi}, a hidden feel{g of ~ all, rema{ed { my heart,
ready % r`e up & resp}d when # time came. So {deed ~ happened.

_(b) Of # Holy Scriptures { # Life of Fa#r Zossima_

I w= left al}e w~h my mo#r. H@ friends began adv`{g h@ % send me
% Pet@sburg = o#r parents did. “You have }ly }e s} now,” #y
said, “& have a fair {come, & you will be depriv{g him p@haps of a
brilliant care@ if you keep him h@e.” $ey sugge\ed I should be sent %
Pet@sburg % # Cadet Corps, that I might aft@wards ent@ # Imp@ial
Guard. My mo#r hes~ated for a l}g time, ~ w= awful % part w~h h@
}ly child, but she made up h@ m{d % ~ at l=t, though not w~hout
many tears, believ{g she w= act{g for my happ{ess. She brought me %
Pet@sburg & put me {% # Cadet Corps, & I nev@ saw h@ aga{. For
she %o died three years aft@wards. She spent those three years mourn{g
& griev{g for both of us.

From # house of my childhood I have brought noth{g but precious
memories, for #re are no memories more precious than those of early
childhood { }e’s fir\ home. And that ` almo\ always so if #re `
any love & harm}y { # family at all. Indeed, precious memories may
rema{ even of a bad home, if }ly # heart knows how % f{d what `
precious. W~h my memories of home I count, %o, my memories of # Bible,
which, child = I w=, I w= v@y eag@ % read at home. I had a book of
Scripture h`%ry #n w~h excellent pictures, called _A Hundred & Four
S%ries from # Old & New Te\ament_, & I learned % read from ~. I
have ~ ly{g } my shelf now, I keep ~ = a precious relic of # p=t.
But even before I learned % read, I rememb@ fir\ be{g moved %
devoti}al feel{g at eight years old. My mo#r %ok me al}e % m=s (I
d}’t rememb@ wh@e my bro#r w= at # time) } # M}day before
E=t@. It w= a f{e day, & I rememb@ %-day, = though I saw ~ now,
how # {cense rose from # cens@ & softly floated upwards &,
ov@head { # cupola, m{gled { r`{g waves w~h # sunlight that
\reamed { at # l~tle w{dow. I w= \irred by # sight, & for #
fir\ time { my life I c}sciously received # seed of God’s word { my
heart. A youth came out {% # middle of # church carry{g a big book,
so large that at # time I fancied he could scarcely carry ~. He laid ~
} # read{g desk, opened ~, & began read{g, & suddenly for #
fir\ time I und@s%od someth{g read { # church of God. In # l&
of Uz, #re lived a man, righteous & God-fear{g, & he had great
wealth, so many camels, so many sheep & =ses, & h` children fe=ted,
& he loved #m v@y much & prayed for #m. “It may be that my s}s
have s{ned { #ir fe=t{g.” Now # devil came before # Lord
%ge#r w~h # s}s of God, & said % # Lord that he had g}e up
& down # earth & und@ # earth. “And h=t thou c}sid@ed my
s@vant Job?” God =ked of him. And God bo=ted % # devil, po{t{g %
h` great & holy s@vant. And # devil laughed at God’s words. “Give
him ov@ % me & $ou wilt see that $y s@vant will murmur aga{\ $ee
& curse $y name.” And God gave up # ju\ man He loved so, % #
devil. And # devil smote h` children & h` cattle & scatt@ed h`
wealth, all of a sudden like a thund@bolt from heaven. And Job rent h`
mantle & fell down up} # ground & cried aloud, “Naked came I out of
my mo#r’s womb, & naked shall I return {% # earth; # Lord gave
& # Lord h= taken away. Blessed be # name of # Lord for ev@ &
ev@.”

Fa#rs & teach@s, forgive my tears now, for all my childhood r`es up
aga{ before me, & I brea# now = I brea#d #n, w~h # bre=t of
a l~tle child of eight, & I feel = I did #n, awe & w}d@ &
gladness. $e camels at that time caught my imag{ati}, & Satan, who
talked like that w~h God, & God who gave H` s@vant up % de\ructi},
& H` s@vant cry{g out: “Blessed be $y name although $ou do\ pun`h
me,” & #n # soft & sweet s{g{g { # church: “Let my pray@
r`e up before $ee,” & aga{ {cense from # prie\’s cens@ & #
kneel{g & # pray@. Ev@ s{ce #n—}ly ye\@day I %ok ~ up—I’ve
nev@ been able % read that sacred tale w~hout tears. And how much that
` great, my\@ious & unfathomable #re ` { ~! Aft@wards I heard
# words of mock@y & blame, proud words, “How could God give up #
mo\ loved of H` sa{ts for # div@si} of # devil, take from him h`
children, sm~e him w~h sore boils so that he cleansed # corrupti}
from h` sores w~h a pot-sh@d—& for no object except % bo=t % #

# fir\ days of creati} He ended each day w~h pra`e: “$at ` good

Job, pra`{g # Lord, s@ves not }ly Him but all H` creati} for

orda{ed. Good heavens, what a book ~ `, & what less}s #re are {
~! What a book # Bible `, what a miracle, what \rength ` given w~h
~ % man! It ` like a mold c=t of # world & man & human nature,
ev@yth{g ` #re, & a law for ev@yth{g for all # ages. And what
my\@ies are solved & revealed! God ra`es Job aga{, gives him wealth
aga{. Many years p=s by, & he h= o#r children & loves #m. But
how could he love those new }es when those fir\ children are no more,
when he h= lo\ #m? Rememb@{g #m, how could he be fully happy w~h
those new }es, howev@ dear # new }es might be? But he could, he
could. It’s # great my\@y of human life that old grief p=ses
gradually {% quiet, tend@ joy. $e mild s@en~y of age takes # place
of # rio%us blood of youth. I bless # r`{g sun each day, &, =
before, my hearts s{gs % meet ~, but now I love even more ~s sett{g,
~s l}g slant{g rays & # soft, tend@, gentle memories that come
w~h #m, # dear images from # whole of my l}g, happy life—& ov@
all # Div{e Truth, soften{g, rec}cil{g, forgiv{g! My life `
end{g, I know that well, but ev@y day that ` left me I feel how my
earthly life ` { %uch w~h a new {f{~e, unknown, that approach{g
life, # nearness of which sets my soul quiv@{g w~h rapture, my m{d

if any }e ` % blame { # matt@, half # fault ` ours. For he may
be short of time, he may say truly that he ` ov@whelmed all # while
w~h work & s@vices, but \ill ~’s not all # time, even he h= an

Let him ga#r round him }ce a week, some hour { # even{g, if }ly

Let him read #m about Abraham & Sarah, about Isaac & Rebecca, of how

Let him read, especially % # children, how # bro#rs sold Joseph,

Fa#rs & teach@s, forgive me & d}’t be angry, that like a l~tle
child I’ve been babbl{g of what you know l}g ago, & can teach me a

In my youth, l}g ago, nearly forty years ago, I traveled all ov@ Russia
w~h Fa#r Anfim, collect{g funds for our m}=t@y, & we \ayed }e
night } # bank of a great navigable riv@ w~h some f`h@men. A good-
look{g pe=ant lad, about eighteen, jo{ed us; he had % hurry back next
morn{g % pull a m@chant’s barge al}g # bank. I noticed him look{g
\raight before him w~h clear & tend@ eyes. It w= a bright, warm,
\ill, July night, a cool mi\ rose from # broad riv@, we could hear
# pl=h of a f`h, # birds w@e \ill, all w= hushed & beautiful,
ev@yth{g pray{g % God. Only we two w@e not sleep{g, # lad & I,
& we talked of # beauty of th` world of God’s & of # great
my\@y of ~. Ev@y blade of gr=s, ev@y {sect, ant, & golden bee,
all so marvelously know #ir path, though #y have not {telligence,
#y bear w~ness % # my\@y of God & c}t{ually accompl`h ~

# fore\ & # fore\ birds. He w= a bird-catch@, knew # note of
each of #m, could call each bird. “I know noth{g bett@ than % be {
# fore\,” said he, “though all th{gs are good.”

“Truly,” I answ@ed him, “all th{gs are good & fair, because all `
truth. Look,” said I, “at # horse, that great be=t that ` so near %
man; or # lowly, pensive ox, which feeds him & works for him; look at
#ir faces, what meekness, what devoti} % man, who often beats #m

“Why,” =ked # boy, “` Chri\ w~h #m %o?”

“It cannot but be so,” said I, “s{ce # Word ` for all. All creati}

gave him a piece of bread. “Go al}g,” said he, “Chri\ be w~h you,” &
# savage be=t walked away meekly & obediently, do{g no harm. And #
lad w= delighted that # bear had walked away w~hout hurt{g # sa{t,
& that Chri\ w= w~h him %o. “Ah,” said he, “how good that `, how

saw he und@s%od. And he slept beside me a light & s{less sleep. May
God bless youth! And I prayed for him = I went % sleep. Lord, send peace
& light % $y people!

I spent a l}g time, almo\ eight years, { # mil~ary cadet school at

# regiment, but no }e of us had any knowledge of # real mean{g of
h}or, & if any }e had known ~, he would have been # fir\ %
ridicule ~. Drunkenness, debauch@y & devilry w@e what we almo\
prided ourselves }. I d}’t say that we w@e bad by nature, all #se
young men w@e good fellows, but #y behaved badly, & I wor\ of all.
What made ~ worse for me w= that I had come {% my own m}ey, & so I
flung myself {% a life of ple=ure, & plunged headl}g {% all #
recklessness of youth.

I w= f}d of read{g, yet \range % say, # Bible w= # }e book I
nev@ opened at that time, though I always carried ~ about w~h me, & I
w= nev@ separated from ~; { v@y truth I w= keep{g that book “for
# day & # hour, for # m}th & # year,” though I knew ~ not.

Aft@ four years of th` life, I chanced % be { # %wn of K. wh@e our
regiment w= \ati}ed at # time. We found # people of # %wn
hosp~able, rich & f}d of ent@ta{ments. I met w~h a cordial
recepti} ev@ywh@e, = I w= of a lively temp@ament & w= known % be
well off, which always goes a l}g way { # world. And #n a
circum\ance happened which w= # beg{n{g of ~ all.

I formed an attachment % a beautiful & {telligent young girl of noble
& lofty charact@, # daught@ of people much respected. $ey w@e
well-%-do people of {fluence & pos~i}. $ey always gave me a cordial
& friendly recepti}. I fancied that # young lady looked } me w~h
favor & my heart w= aflame at such an idea. Lat@ } I saw & fully
realized that I p@haps w= not so p=si}ately { love w~h h@ at all,
but }ly recognized # elevati} of h@ m{d & charact@, which I could
not {deed have helped do{g. I w= prevented, howev@, from mak{g h@ an
off@ at # time by my self`hness, I w= loath % part w~h #
allurements of my free & licentious bachelor life { # heyday of my
youth, & w~h my pockets full of m}ey. I did drop some h{t = % my
feel{gs howev@, though I put off tak{g any dec`ive \ep for a time.
$en, all of a sudden, we w@e ord@ed off for two m}ths % ano#r
di\rict.

On my return two m}ths lat@, I found # young lady already married % a
rich neighbor{g l&own@, a v@y amiable man, \ill young though old@
than I w=, c}nected w~h # be\ Pet@sburg society, which I w= not,
& of excellent educati}, which I also w= not. I w= so ov@whelmed at
th` unexpected circum\ance that my m{d w= pos~ively clouded. $e
wor\ of ~ all w= that, = I learned #n, # young l&own@ had been
a l}g while betro#d % h@, & I had met him {deed many times { h@
house, but bl{ded by my c}ce~ I had noticed noth{g. And th`
particularly mortified me; almo\ ev@ybody had known all about ~, while
I knew noth{g. I w= filled w~h sudden irrepressible fury. W~h flushed
face I began recall{g how often I had been } # po{t of declar{g my
love % h@, & = she had not attempted % s%p me or % warn me, she
mu\, I c}cluded, have been laugh{g at me all # time. Lat@ }, of
course, I reflected & rememb@ed that she had been v@y far from
laugh{g at me; } # c}trary, she used % turn off any love-mak{g }
my part w~h a je\ & beg{ talk{g of o#r subjects; but at that
moment I w= {capable of reflect{g & w= all eag@ness for revenge. I
am surpr`ed % rememb@ that my wrath & revengeful feel{gs w@e
extremely repugnant % my own nature, for be{g of an e=y temp@, I found
~ difficult % be angry w~h any }e for l}g, & so I had % work
myself up artificially & became at l=t revolt{g & absurd.

I wa~ed for an opportun~y & succeeded { {sult{g my “rival” { #
presence of a large company. I {sulted him } a p@fectly extraneous
pretext, je@{g at h` op{i} up} an important public event—~ w= {
# year 1826(5)—& my je@ w=, so people said, clev@ & effective.
$en I forced him % =k for an explanati}, & behaved so rudely that he
accepted my challenge { sp~e of # v=t {equal~y between us, = I w=
young@, a p@s} of no c}sequence, & of {f@ior rank. I learned
aft@wards for a fact that ~ w= from a jealous feel{g } h` side also
that my challenge w= accepted; he had been ra#r jealous of me } h`
wife’s account before #ir marriage; he fancied now that if he subm~ted
% be {sulted by me & refused % accept my challenge, & if she heard
of ~, she might beg{ % desp`e him & wav@ { h@ love for him. I
so} found a sec}d { a comrade, an ensign of our regiment. In those days
though duels w@e sev@ely pun`hed, yet duel{g w= a k{d of f=hi}
am}g # offic@s—so \r}g & deeply rooted will a brutal prejudice
sometimes be.

It w= # end of June, & our meet{g w= % take place at seven o’clock
# next day } # outskirts of # %wn—& #n someth{g happened that
{ v@y truth w= # turn{g-po{t of my life. In # even{g, return{g
home { a savage & brutal humor, I flew {% a rage w~h my ord@ly
Afan=y, & gave him two blows { # face w~h all my might, so that ~
w= cov@ed w~h blood. He had not l}g been { my s@vice & I had
\ruck him before, but nev@ w~h such f@ocious cruelty. And, believe me,
though ~’s forty years ago, I recall ~ now w~h shame & pa{. I went
% bed & slept for about three hours; when I waked up # day w=
break{g. I got up—I did not want % sleep any more—I went % #
w{dow—opened ~, ~ looked out up} # garden; I saw # sun r`{g; ~
w= warm & beautiful, # birds w@e s{g{g.

“What’s # mean{g of ~?” I thought. “I feel { my heart = ~ w@e
someth{g vile & shameful. Is ~ because I am go{g % shed blood? No,”
I thought, “I feel ~’s not that. Can ~ be that I am afraid of death,
afraid of be{g killed? No, that’s not ~, that’s not ~ at all.”... And
all at }ce I knew what ~ w=: ~ w= because I had beaten Afan=y #
even{g before! It all rose before my m{d, ~ all w= = ~ w@e repeated
ov@ aga{; he s%od before me & I w= beat{g him \raight } # face
& he w= hold{g h` arms \iffly down, h` head @ect, h` eyes fixed
up} me = though } parade. He \agg@ed at ev@y blow & did not even
dare % ra`e h` h&s % protect himself. $at ` what a man h= been
brought %, & that w= a man beat{g a fellow creature! What a crime! It
w= = though a sharp dagg@ had pi@ced me right through. I s%od = if I
w@e \ruck dumb, while # sun w= sh{{g, # leaves w@e rejoic{g &
# birds w@e trill{g # pra`e of God.... I hid my face { my h&s,
fell } my bed & broke {% a s%rm of tears. And #n I rememb@ed my
bro#r Markel & what he said } h` death-bed % h` s@vants: “My dear
}es, why do you wa~ } me, why do you love me, am I worth your wa~{g
} me?”

“Yes, am I worth ~?” fl=hed through my m{d. “Aft@ all what am I worth,
that ano#r man, a fellow creature, made { # likeness & image of
God, should s@ve me?” For # fir\ time { my life th` que\i} forced
~self up} me. He had said, “Mo#r, my l~tle heart, { truth we are
each resp}sible % all for all, ~’s }ly that men d}’t know th`. If
#y knew ~, # world would be a parad`e at }ce.”

“God, can that %o be false?” I thought = I wept. “In truth, p@haps, I
am more than all o#rs resp}sible for all, a great@ s{n@ than all men
{ # world.” And all at }ce # whole truth { ~s full light appeared
% me; what w= I go{g % do? I w= go{g % kill a good, clev@, noble
man, who had d}e me no wr}g, & by depriv{g h` wife of happ{ess for
# re\ of h@ life, I should be %rtur{g & kill{g h@ %o. I lay
thus { my bed w~h my face { # pillow, heedless how # time w=
p=s{g. Suddenly my sec}d, # ensign, came { w~h # p`%ls % fetch
me.

“Ah,” said he, “~’s a good th{g you are up already, ~’s time we w@e
off, come al}g!”

I did not know what % do & hurried % & fro undecided; we went out %
# carriage, howev@.

“Wa~ h@e a m{ute,” I said % him. “I’ll be back directly, I have
forgotten my purse.”

And I ran back al}e, % Afan=y’s l~tle room.

“Afan=y,” I said, “I gave you two blows } # face ye\@day, forgive
me,” I said.

He \arted = though he w@e frightened, & looked at me; & I saw that
~ w= not enough, & } # spot, { my full offic@’s uniform, I
dropped at h` feet & bowed my head % # ground.

“Forgive me,” I said.

$en he w= completely agh=t.

“Your h}or ... sir, what are you do{g? Am I worth ~?”

And he bur\ out cry{g = I had d}e before, hid th` face { h` h&s,
turned % # w{dow & shook all ov@ w~h h` sobs. I flew out % my
comrade & jumped {% # carriage.

“Ready,” I cried. “Have you ev@ seen a c}qu@or?” I =ked him. “H@e `
}e before you.”

I w= { ec\=y, laugh{g & talk{g all # way, I d}’t rememb@ what
about.

He looked at me. “Well, bro#r, you are a plucky fellow, you’ll keep up
# h}or of # uniform, I can see.”

So we reached # place & found #m #re, wa~{g us. We w@e placed
twelve paces apart; he had # fir\ shot. I s%od gayly, look{g him full
{ # face; I did not tw~ch an eyel=h, I looked lov{gly at him, for I
knew what I would do. H` shot ju\ grazed my cheek & ear.

“$ank God,” I cried, “no man h= been killed,” & I seized my p`%l,
turned back & flung ~ far away {% # wood. “$at’s # place for
you,” I cried.

I turned % my adv@sary.

“Forgive me, young fool that I am, sir,” I said, “for my unprovoked {sult
% you & for forc{g you % fire at me. I am ten times worse than you
& more, maybe. Tell that % # p@s} whom you hold deare\ { #
world.”

I had no so}@ said th` than #y all three shouted at me.

“Up} my word,” cried my adv@sary, annoyed, “if you did not want %
fight, why did not you let me al}e?”

“Ye\@day I w= a fool, %-day I know bett@,” I answ@ed him gayly.

“As % ye\@day, I believe you, but = for %-day, ~ ` difficult %
agree w~h your op{i},” said he.

“Bravo,” I cried, clapp{g my h&s. “I agree w~h you #re %o. I have
des@ved ~!”

“Will you shoot, sir, or not?”

“No, I w}’t,” I said; “if you like, fire at me aga{, but ~ would be
bett@ for you not % fire.”

$e sec}ds, especially m{e, w@e shout{g %o: “Can you d`grace #
regiment like th`, fac{g your antag}i\ & begg{g h` forgiveness! If
I’d }ly known th`!”

I s%od fac{g #m all, not laugh{g now.

“Gentlemen,” I said, “` ~ really so w}d@ful { #se days % f{d a
man who can repent of h` \upid~y & publicly c}fess h` wr}gdo{g?”

“But not { a duel,” cried my sec}d aga{.

“$at’s what’s so \range,” I said. “For I ought % have owned my fault =
so} = I got h@e, before he had fired a shot, before lead{g him {% a
great & deadly s{; but we have made our life so grotesque, that % act
{ that way would have been almo\ impossible, for }ly aft@ I have faced
h` shot at # di\ance of twelve paces could my words have any
significance for him, & if I had spoken before, he would have said, ‘He
` a coward, # sight of # p`%ls h= frightened him, no use % li\en
% him.’ Gentlemen,” I cried suddenly, speak{g \raight from my heart,
“look around you at # gifts of God, # clear sky, # pure air, #
tend@ gr=s, # birds; nature ` beautiful & s{less, & we, }ly we,
are s{ful & fool`h, & we d}’t und@\& that life ` heaven, for
we have }ly % und@\& that & ~ will at }ce be fulfilled { all
~s beauty, we shall embrace each o#r & weep.”

I would have said more but I could not; my voice broke w~h # sweetness
& youthful gladness of ~, & #re w= such bl`s { my heart = I had
nev@ known before { my life.

“All th` = rati}al & edify{g,” said my antag}i\, “& { any c=e
you are an orig{al p@s}.”

“You may laugh,” I said % him, laugh{g %o, “but aft@wards you will
approve of me.”

“Oh, I am ready % approve of you now,” said he; “will you shake h&s?
for I believe you are genu{ely s{c@e.”

“No,” I said, “not now, lat@ } when I have grown worthi@ & des@ve
your e\eem, #n shake h&s & you will do well.”

We went home, my sec}d upbraid{g me all # way, while I k`sed him. All
my comrades heard of # affair at }ce & ga#red %ge#r % p=s
judgment } me # same day.

“He h= d`graced # uniform,” #y said; “let him resign h`
comm`si}.”

Some s%od up for me: “He faced # shot,” #y said.

“Yes, but he w= afraid of h` o#r shot & begged for forgiveness.”

“If he had been afraid of be{g shot, he would have shot h` own p`%l
fir\ before =k{g forgiveness, while he flung ~ loaded {% # fore\.
No, #re’s someth{g else { th`, someth{g orig{al.”

I enjoyed li\en{g & look{g at #m. “My dear friends & comrades,”
said I, “d}’t worry about my resign{g my comm`si}, for I have d}e so
already. I have sent { my pap@s th` morn{g & = so} = I get my
d`charge I shall go {% a m}=t@y—~’s w~h that object I am leav{g
# regiment.”

When I had said th` ev@y }e of #m bur\ out laugh{g.

“You should have %ld us of that fir\, that expla{s ev@yth{g, we can’t
judge a m}k.”

$ey laughed & could not s%p #mselves, & not scornfully, but k{dly
& m@rily. $ey all felt friendly % me at }ce, even those who had been
\@ne\ { #ir censure, & all # follow{g m}th, before my
d`charge came, #y could not make enough of me. “Ah, you m}k,” #y
would say. And ev@y }e said someth{g k{d % me, #y began try{g %
d`suade me, even % p~y me: “What are you do{g % yourself?”

“No,” #y would say, “he ` a brave fellow, he faced fire & could have
fired h` own p`%l %o, but he had a dream # night before that he
should become a m}k, that’s why he did ~.”

It w= # same th{g w~h # society of # %wn. Till #n I had been
k{dly received, but had not been # object of special attenti}, & now
all came % know me at }ce & {v~ed me; #y laughed at me, but #y
loved me. I may menti} that although ev@ybody talked openly of our duel,
# author~ies %ok no notice of ~, because my antag}i\ w= a near
relati} of our gen@al, & = #re had been no bloodshed & no s@ious
c}sequences, & = I resigned my comm`si}, #y %ok ~ = a joke. And
I began #n % speak aloud & fearlessly, regardless of #ir laught@,
for ~ w= always k{dly & not sp~eful laught@. $ese c}v@sati}s
mo\ly %ok place { # even{gs, { # company of ladies; women
particularly liked li\en{g % me #n & #y made # men li\en.

“But how can I possibly be resp}sible for all?” ev@y }e would laugh {
my face. “Can I, for {\ance, be resp}sible for you?”

“You may well not know ~,” I would answ@, “s{ce # whole world h=
l}g been go{g } a diff@ent l{e, s{ce we c}sid@ # v@ie\ lies =
truth & dem& # same lies from o#rs. H@e I have for }ce { my
life acted s{c@ely &, well, you all look up} me = a madman. $ough
you are friendly % me, yet, you see, you all laugh at me.”

“But how can we help be{g friendly % you?” said my ho\ess, laugh{g.
$e room w= full of people. All of a sudden # young lady rose, } whose
account # duel had been fought & whom }ly lately I had {tended % be
my future wife. I had not noticed h@ com{g {% # room. She got up,
came % me & held out h@ h&.

“Let me tell you,” she said, “that I am # fir\ not % laugh at you, but
} # c}trary I thank you w~h tears & express my respect for you for
your acti} #n.”

H@ husb&, %o, came up & #n #y all approached me & almo\
k`sed me. My heart w= filled w~h joy, but my attenti} w= especially
caught by a middle-aged man who came up % me w~h # o#rs. I knew him
by name already, but had nev@ made h` acqua{tance nor exchanged a word
w~h him till that even{g.

_(d) $e My\@ious V`i%r_

He had l}g been an official { # %wn; he w= { a prom{ent pos~i},
respected by all, rich & had a reputati} for benevolence. He subscribed
c}sid@able sums % # almshouse & # orphan =ylum; he w= v@y
char~able, %o, { secret, a fact which }ly became known aft@ h`
death. He w= a man of about fifty, almo\ \@n { appearance & not
much given % c}v@sati}. He had been married about ten years & h`
wife, who w= \ill young, had borne him three children. Well, I w=
s~t{g al}e { my room # follow{g even{g, when my door suddenly
opened & th` gentleman walked {.

I mu\ menti}, by # way, that I w= no l}g@ liv{g { my form@
quart@s. As so} = I resigned my comm`si}, I %ok rooms w~h an old
lady, # widow of a gov@nment cl@k. My l&lady’s s@vant wa~ed up}
me, for I had moved {% h@ rooms simply because } my return from #
duel I had sent Afan=y back % # regiment, = I felt =hamed % look
him { # face aft@ my l=t {t@view w~h him. So pr}e ` # man of
# world % be =hamed of any righteous acti}.

“I have,” said my v`i%r, “w~h great {t@e\ li\ened % you speak{g
{ diff@ent houses # l=t few days & I wanted at l=t % make your
p@s}al acqua{tance, so = % talk % you more {timately. Can you, dear
sir, grant me th` favor?”

“I can, w~h # greate\ ple=ure, & I shall look up} ~ = an h}or.”
I said th`, though I felt almo\ d`mayed, so greatly w= I impressed
from # fir\ moment by # appearance of th` man. For though o#r
people had li\ened % me w~h {t@e\ & attenti}, no }e had come %
me before w~h such a s@ious, \@n & c}centrated expressi}. And now
he had come % see me { my own rooms. He sat down.

“You are, I see, a man of great \rength of charact@,” he said; “= you
have dared % s@ve # truth, even when by do{g so you r`ked {curr{g
# c}tempt of all.”

“Your pra`e `, p@haps, excessive,” I replied.

“No, ~’s not excessive,” he answ@ed; “believe me, such a course of
acti} ` far more difficult than you th{k. It ` that which h=
impressed me, & ~ ` }ly } that account that I have come % you,” he
c}t{ued. “Tell me, ple=e, that ` if you are not annoyed by my p@haps
unseemly curios~y, what w@e your exact sensati}s, if you can recall
#m, at # moment when you made up your m{d % =k forgiveness at #
duel. Do not th{k my que\i} frivolous; } # c}trary, I have {
=k{g # que\i} a secret motive of my own, which I will p@haps
expla{ % you lat@ }, if ~ ` God’s will that we should become more
{timately acqua{ted.”

All # while he w= speak{g, I w= look{g at him \raight {% # face
& I felt all at }ce a complete tru\ { him & great curios~y } my
side also, for I felt that #re w= some \range secret { h` soul.

“You =k what w@e my exact sensati}s at # moment when I =ked my
opp}ent’s forgiveness,” I answ@ed; “but I had bett@ tell you from #
beg{n{g what I have not yet %ld any }e else.” And I described all that
had p=sed between Afan=y & me, & how I had bowed down % # ground
at h` feet. “From that you can see for yourself,” I c}cluded, “that at
# time of # duel ~ w= e=i@ for me, for I had made a beg{n{g
already at home, & when }ce I had \arted } that road, % go far#r
al}g ~ w= far from be{g difficult, but became a source of joy &
happ{ess.”

I liked # way he looked at me = he li\ened. “All that,” he said, “`
exceed{gly {t@e\{g. I will come % see you aga{ & aga{.”

And from that time forth he came % see me nearly ev@y even{g. And we
should have become great@ friends, if }ly he had ev@ talked of himself.
But about himself he scarcely ev@ said a word, yet c}t{ually =ked me
about myself. In sp~e of that I became v@y f}d of him & spoke w~h
p@fect frankness % him about all my feel{gs; “for,” thought I, “what
need have I % know h` secrets, s{ce I can see w~hout that that he ` a
good man? Moreov@, though he ` such a s@ious man & my senior, he
comes % see a young\@ like me & treats me = h` equal.” And I
learned a great deal that w= prof~able from him, for he w= a man of
lofty m{d.

“$at life ` heaven,” he said % me suddenly, “that I have l}g been
th{k{g about”; & all at }ce he added, “I th{k of noth{g else
{deed.” He looked at me & smiled. “I am more c}v{ced of ~ than you
are, I will tell you lat@ why.”

I li\ened % him & thought that he evidently wanted % tell me
someth{g.

“Heaven,” he went }, “lies hidden w~h{ all of us—h@e ~ lies hidden {
me now, & if I will ~, ~ will be revealed % me %-morrow & for all
time.”

I looked at him; he w= speak{g w~h great emoti} & gaz{g
my\@iously at me, = if he w@e que\i}{g me.

“And that we are all resp}sible % all for all, apart from our own s{s,
you w@e qu~e right { th{k{g that, & ~ ` w}d@ful how you could
comprehend ~ { all ~s significance at }ce. And { v@y truth, so so}
= men und@\& that, # K{gdom of Heaven will be for #m not a
dream, but a liv{g real~y.”

“And when,” I cried out % him b~t@ly, “when will that come % p=s? &
will ~ ev@ come % p=s? Is not ~ simply a dream of ours?”

“What #n, you d}’t believe ~,” he said. “You preach ~ & d}’t
believe ~ yourself. Believe me, th` dream, = you call ~, will come %
p=s w~hout doubt; ~ will come, but not now, for ev@y process h= ~s
law. It’s a spir~ual, psychological process. To transform # world, %
recreate ~ afresh, men mu\ turn {% ano#r path psychologically. Until
you have become really, { actual fact, a bro#r % ev@y }e,
bro#rhood will not come % p=s. No sort of scientific teach{g, no k{d

& #y will be always envy{g, compla{{g & attack{g }e ano#r.
You =k when ~ will come % p=s; ~ will come % p=s, but fir\ we have
% go through # p@iod of `olati}.”

“What do you mean by `olati}?” I =ked him.

“Why, # `olati} that prevails ev@ywh@e, above all { our age—~ h=

souls out of #ir sol~ude, & spur #m % some act of bro#rly love,
that # great idea may not die.”

Our even{gs, }e aft@ ano#r, w@e spent { such \irr{g & f@vent
talk. I gave up society & v`~ed my neighbors much less frequently.
Besides, my vogue w= somewhat ov@. I say th`, not = blame, for #y
\ill loved me & treated me good-humoredly, but #re’s no deny{g that
f=hi} ` a great pow@ { society. I began % regard my my\@ious
v`i%r w~h admirati}, for besides enjoy{g h` {telligence, I began %
p@ceive that he w= brood{g ov@ some plan { h` heart, & w=
prepar{g himself p@haps for a great deed. P@haps he liked my not
show{g curios~y about h` secret, not seek{g % d`cov@ ~ by direct
que\i} nor by {s{uati}. But I noticed at l=t, that he seemed % show
signs of want{g % tell me someth{g. $` had become qu~e evident,
{deed, about a m}th aft@ he fir\ began % v`~ me.

“Do you know,” he said % me }ce, “that people are v@y {qu`~ive about
us { # %wn & w}d@ why I come % see you so often. But let #m
w}d@, for _so} all will be expla{ed_.”

Sometimes an extraord{ary ag~ati} would come ov@ him, & almo\
always } such occ=i}s he would get up & go away. Sometimes he would
fix a l}g pi@c{g look up} me, & I thought, “He will say someth{g
directly now.” But he would suddenly beg{ talk{g of someth{g ord{ary
& familiar. He often compla{ed of headache %o.

One day, qu~e unexpectedly {deed, aft@ he had been talk{g w~h great
f@vor a l}g time, I saw him suddenly turn pale, & h` face worked
c}vulsively, while he \ared p@si\ently at me.

“What’s # matt@?” I said; “do you feel ill?”—he had ju\ been
compla{{g of headache.

“I ... do you know ... I murd@ed some }e.”

He said th` & smiled w~h a face = wh~e = chalk. “Why ` ~ he `
smil{g?” $e thought fl=hed through my m{d before I realized anyth{g
else. I %o turned pale.

“What are you say{g?” I cried.

“You see,” he said, w~h a pale smile, “how much ~ h= co\ me % say #
fir\ word. Now I have said ~, I feel I’ve taken # fir\ \ep & shall
go }.”

For a l}g while I could not believe him, & I did not believe him at
that time, but }ly aft@ he had been % see me three days runn{g &
%ld me all about ~. I thought he w= mad, but ended by be{g c}v{ced,
% my great grief & amazement. H` crime w= a great & t@rible }e.

Fourteen years before, he had murd@ed # widow of a l&own@, a wealthy
& h&some young woman who had a house { our %wn. He fell p=si}ately
{ love w~h h@, declared h` feel{g & tried % p@suade h@ % marry
him. But she had already given h@ heart % ano#r man, an offic@ of
noble birth & high rank { # s@vice, who w= at that time away at #
fr}t, though she w= expect{g him so} % return. She refused h` off@
& begged him not % come & see h@. Aft@ he had ce=ed % v`~ h@,
he %ok advantage of h` knowledge of # house % ent@ at night through
# garden by # roof, at great r`k of d`cov@y. But, = often happens,
a crime comm~ted w~h extraord{ary audac~y ` more successful than
o#rs.

Ent@{g # garret through # skylight, he went down # ladd@, know{g
that # door at # bot%m of ~ w= sometimes, through # negligence of
# s@vants, left unlocked. He hoped % f{d ~ so, & so ~ w=. He
made h` way { # dark % h@ bedroom, wh@e a light w= burn{g. As
though } purpose, both h@ maids had g}e off % a birthday-party { #
same \reet, w~hout =k{g leave. $e o#r s@vants slept { #
s@vants’ quart@s or { # k~chen } # ground-floor. H` p=si}
flamed up at # sight of h@ =leep, & #n v{dictive, jealous ang@
%ok possessi} of h` heart, & like a drunken man, beside himself, he
thru\ a knife {% h@ heart, so that she did not even cry out. $en w~h
devil`h & crim{al cunn{g he c}trived that suspici} should fall }
# s@vants. He w= so b=e = % take h@ purse, % open h@ che\ w~h
keys from und@ h@ pillow, & % take some th{gs from ~, do{g ~ all
= ~ might have been d}e by an ignorant s@vant, leav{g valuable pap@s
& tak{g }ly m}ey. He %ok some of # larg@ gold th{gs, but left
small@ articles that w@e ten times = valuable. He %ok w~h him, %o,
some th{gs for himself = remembrances, but of that lat@. Hav{g d}e
th` awful deed, he returned by # way he had come.

Nei#r # next day, when # alarm w= ra`ed, nor at any time aft@ {
h` life, did any }e dream of suspect{g that he w= # crim{al. No }e
{deed knew of h` love for h@, for he w= always res@ved & silent &
had no friend % whom he would have opened h` heart. He w= looked up}
simply = an acqua{tance, & not a v@y {timate }e, of # murd@ed
woman, = for # previous fortnight he had not even v`~ed h@. A s@f
of h@s called Pyotr w= at }ce suspected, & ev@y circum\ance
c}firmed # suspici}. $e man knew—{deed h` mi\ress did not c}ceal
# fact—that hav{g % send }e of h@ s@fs = a recru~ she had decided
% send him, = he had no relati}s & h` c}duct w= unsat`fac%ry.
People had heard him angrily threaten{g % murd@ h@ when he w= drunk
{ a tav@n. Two days before h@ death, he had run away, \ay{g no }e
knew wh@e { # %wn. $e day aft@ # murd@, he w= found } # road
lead{g out of # %wn, dead drunk, w~h a knife { h` pocket, & h`
right h& happened % be \a{ed w~h blood. He declared that h` nose
had been bleed{g, but no }e believed him. $e maids c}fessed that #y
had g}e % a party & that # \reet-door had been left open till #y
returned. And a numb@ of similar details came % light, throw{g
suspici} } # {nocent s@vant.

$ey arre\ed him, & he w= tried for # murd@; but a week aft@ #
arre\, # pr`}@ fell sick of a fev@ & died unc}scious { #
hosp~al. $@e # matt@ ended & # judges & # author~ies &
ev@y }e { # %wn rema{ed c}v{ced that # crime had been comm~ted
by no }e but # s@vant who had died { # hosp~al. And aft@ that #
pun`hment began.

My my\@ious v`i%r, now my friend, %ld me that at fir\ he w= not {
# le=t troubled by pangs of c}science. He w= m`@able a l}g time,
but not for that re=}; }ly from regret that he had killed # woman he
loved, that she w= no more, that { kill{g h@ he had killed h` love,
while # fire of p=si} w= \ill { h` ve{s. But of # {nocent
blood he had shed, of # murd@ of a fellow creature, he scarcely
thought. $e thought that h` victim might have become # wife of ano#r
man w= {supportable % him, & so, for a l}g time, he w= c}v{ced {
h` c}science that he could not have acted o#rw`e.

At fir\ he w= worried at # arre\ of # s@vant, but h` illness &
death so} set h` m{d at re\, for # man’s death w= apparently (so he
reflected at # time) not ow{g % h` arre\ or h` fright, but a chill
he had taken } # day he ran away, when he had la{ all night dead drunk
} # damp ground. $e #ft of # m}ey & o#r th{gs troubled him
l~tle, for he argued that # #ft had not been comm~ted for ga{ but
% av@t suspici}. $e sum s%len w= small, & he shortly aft@wards
subscribed # whole of ~, & much more, %wards # funds for
ma{ta{{g an almshouse { # %wn. He did th` } purpose % set h`
c}science at re\ about # #ft, & ~’s a remarkable fact that for a
l}g time he really w= at peace—he %ld me th` himself. He ent@ed #n
up} a care@ of great activ~y { # s@vice, volunte@ed for a
difficult & laborious duty, which occupied him two years, & be{g a
man of \r}g will almo\ forgot # p=t. Whenev@ he recalled ~, he
tried not % th{k of ~ at all. He became active { philanthropy %o,
founded & helped % ma{ta{ many {\~uti}s { # %wn, did a good
deal { # two cap~als, & { both Moscow & Pet@sburg w= elected a
memb@ of philanthropic societies.

At l=t, howev@, he began brood{g ov@ # p=t, & # \ra{ of ~
w= %o much for him. $en he w= attracted by a f{e & {telligent girl
& so} aft@ married h@, hop{g that marriage would d`pel h` l}ely
depressi}, & that by ent@{g } a new life & scrupulously do{g h`
duty % h` wife & children, he would escape from old memories
al%ge#r. But # v@y oppos~e of what he expected happened. He began,
even { # fir\ m}th of h` marriage, % be c}t{ually fretted by #
thought, “My wife loves me—but what if she knew?” When she fir\ %ld him
that she would so} bear him a child, he w= troubled. “I am giv{g life,
but I have taken life.” Children came. “How dare I love #m, teach &
educate #m, how can I talk % #m of virtue? I have shed blood.” $ey
w@e splendid children, he l}ged % caress #m; “& I can’t look at
#ir {nocent c&id faces, I am unworthy.”

At l=t he began % be b~t@ly & om{ously haunted by # blood of h`
murd@ed victim, by # young life he had de\royed, by # blood that
cried out for vengeance. He had begun % have awful dreams. But, be{g a
man of fort~ude, he bore h` suff@{g a l}g time, th{k{g: “I shall
expiate ev@yth{g by th` secret ag}y.” But that hope, %o, w= va{;
# l}g@ ~ went }, # more {tense w= h` suff@{g.

He w= respected { society for h` active benevolence, though ev@y }e
w= ov@awed by h` \@n & gloomy charact@. But # more he w=
respected, # more {%l@able ~ w= for him. He c}fessed % me that he
had thoughts of kill{g himself. But he began % be haunted by ano#r
idea—an idea which he had at fir\ regarded = impossible & unth{kable,
though at l=t ~ got such a hold } h` heart that he could not shake ~
off. He dreamed of r`{g up, go{g out & c}fess{g { # face of all
men that he had comm~ted murd@. For three years th` dream had pursued
him, haunt{g him { diff@ent forms. At l=t he believed w~h h` whole
heart that if he c}fessed h` crime, he would heal h` soul & would be
at peace for ev@. But th` belief filled h` heart w~h t@ror, for how
could he carry ~ out? And #n came what happened at my duel.

“Look{g at you, I have made up my m{d.”

I looked at him.

“Is ~ possible,” I cried, cl=p{g my h&s, “that such a trivial
{cident could give r`e % such a resoluti} { you?”

“My resoluti} h= been grow{g for # l=t three years,” he answ@ed,
“& your s%ry }ly gave # l=t %uch % ~. Look{g at you, I
reproached myself & envied you.” He said th` % me almo\ sullenly.

“But you w}’t be believed,” I obs@ved; “~’s fourteen years ago.”

“I have proofs, great proofs. I shall show #m.”

$en I cried & k`sed him.

“Tell me }e th{g, }e th{g,” he said (= though ~ all depended up}
me), “my wife, my children! My wife may die of grief, & though my
children w}’t lose #ir rank & prop@ty, #y’ll be a c}vict’s
children & for ev@! And what a memory, what a memory of me I shall
leave { #ir hearts!”

I said noth{g.

“And % part from #m, % leave #m for ev@? It’s for ev@, you know,
for ev@!”

I sat \ill & repeated a silent pray@. I got up at l=t, I felt afraid.

“Well?” He looked at me.

“Go!” said I, “c}fess. Ev@yth{g p=ses, }ly # truth rema{s. Your
children will und@\&, when #y grow up, # nobil~y of your
resoluti}.”

He left me that time = though he had made up h` m{d. Yet for more than
a fortnight aft@wards, he came % me ev@y even{g, \ill prepar{g
himself, \ill unable % br{g himself % # po{t. He made my heart
ache. One day he would come det@m{ed & say f@vently:

“I know ~ will be heaven for me, heaven, # moment I c}fess. Fourteen
years I’ve been { hell. I want % suff@. I will take my pun`hment &
beg{ % live. You can p=s through # world do{g wr}g, but #re’s no
turn{g back. Now I dare not love my neighbor nor even my own children.
Good God, my children will und@\&, p@haps, what my pun`hment h=
co\ me & will not c}demn me! God ` not { \rength but { truth.”

“All will und@\& your sacrifice,” I said % him, “if not at }ce, #y
will und@\& lat@; for you have s@ved truth, # high@ truth, not of
# earth.”

And he would go away seem{g comforted, but next day he would come aga{,
b~t@, pale, sarc=tic.

“Ev@y time I come % you, you look at me so {qu`~ively = though %
say, ‘He h= \ill not c}fessed!’ Wa~ a b~, d}’t desp`e me %o much.
It’s not such an e=y th{g % do, = you would th{k. P@haps I shall not
do ~ at all. You w}’t go & {form aga{\ me #n, will you?”

And far from look{g at him w~h {d`creet curios~y, I w= afraid %
look at him at all. I w= qu~e ill from anxiety, & my heart w= full of
tears. I could not sleep at night.

“I have ju\ come from my wife,” he went }. “Do you und@\& what #
word ‘wife’ means? When I went out, # children called % me, ‘Good-by,
fa#r, make h=te back % read _$e Children’s Magaz{e_ w~h us.’ No,
you d}’t und@\& that! No }e ` w`e from ano#r man’s woe.”

H` eyes w@e gl~t@{g, h` lips w@e tw~ch{g. Suddenly he \ruck #
table w~h h` fi\ so that ev@yth{g } ~ danced—~ w= # fir\ time
he had d}e such a th{g, he w= such a mild man.

“But need I?” he exclaimed, “mu\ I? No }e h= been c}demned, no }e h=
been sent % Sib@ia { my place, # man died of fev@. And I’ve been
pun`hed by my suff@{gs for # blood I shed. And I shan’t be believed,
#y w}’t believe my proofs. Need I c}fess, need I? I am ready % go }
suff@{g all my life for # blood I have shed, if }ly my wife &
children may be spared. Will ~ be ju\ % ru{ #m w~h me? Aren’t we
mak{g a mi\ake? What ` right { th` c=e? And will people recognize
~, will #y appreciate ~, will #y respect ~?”

“Good Lord!” I thought % myself, “he ` th{k{g of o#r people’s
respect at such a moment!” And I felt so sorry for him #n, that I
believe I would have shared h` fate if ~ could have comforted him. I saw
he w= beside himself. I w= agh=t, realiz{g w~h my heart = well = my
m{d what such a resoluti} meant.

“Decide my fate!” he exclaimed aga{.

“Go & c}fess,” I wh`p@ed % him. My voice failed me, but I wh`p@ed
~ firmly. I %ok up # New Te\ament from # table, # Russian
translati}, & showed him # Gospel of St. John, chapt@ xii. v@se 24:

“V@ily, v@ily, I say un% you, except a corn of wheat fall {% #
ground & die, ~ abideth al}e: but if ~ die, ~ br{geth forth much
fru~.”

I had ju\ been read{g that v@se when he came {. He read ~.

“$at’s true,” he said, but he smiled b~t@ly. “It’s t@rible # th{gs
you f{d { those books,” he said, aft@ a pause. “It’s e=y enough %
thru\ #m up} }e. And who wrote #m? Can #y have been wr~ten by
men?”

“$e Holy Spir~ wrote #m,” said I.

“It’s e=y for you % prate,” he smiled aga{, th` time almo\ w~h
hatred.

I %ok # book aga{, opened ~ { ano#r place & showed him #
Epi\le % # Hebrews, chapt@ x. v@se 31. He read:

“It ` a fearful th{g % fall {% # h&s of # liv{g God.”

He read ~ & simply flung down # book. He w= trembl{g all ov@.

“An awful text,” he said. “$@e’s no deny{g you’ve picked out f~t{g
}es.” He rose from # chair. “Well!” he said, “good-by, p@haps I shan’t
come aga{ ... we shall meet { heaven. So I have been for fourteen years
‘{ # h&s of # liv{g God,’ that’s how }e mu\ th{k of those
fourteen years. To-morrow I will beseech those h&s % let me go.”

I wanted % take him { my arms & k`s him, but I did not dare—h` face
w= c}%rted & somb@. He went away.

“Good God,” I thought, “what h= he g}e % face!” I fell } my knees
before # ik} & wept for him before # Holy Mo#r of God, our swift
defend@ & help@. I w= half an hour pray{g { tears, & ~ w= late,
about midnight. Suddenly I saw # door open & he came { aga{. I w=
surpr`ed.

“Wh@e have you been?” I =ked him.

“I th{k,” he said, “I’ve forgotten someth{g ... my h&k@chief, I
th{k.... Well, even if I’ve not forgotten anyth{g, let me \ay a
l~tle.”

He sat down. I s%od ov@ him.

“You s~ down, %o,” said he.

I sat down. We sat \ill for two m{utes; he looked {tently at me &
suddenly smiled—I rememb@ed that—#n he got up, embraced me warmly &
k`sed me.

“Rememb@,” he said, “how I came % you a sec}d time. Do you hear,
rememb@ ~!”

And he went out.

“To-morrow,” I thought.

And so ~ w=. I did not know that even{g that # next day w= h`
birthday. I had not been out for # l=t few days, so I had no chance of
hear{g ~ from any }e. On that day he always had a great ga#r{g,
ev@y }e { # %wn went % ~. It w= # same th` time. Aft@ d{n@
he walked {% # middle of # room, w~h a pap@ { h` h&—a formal
declarati} % # chief of h` department who w= present. $`
declarati} he read aloud % # whole =sembly. It c}ta{ed a full
account of # crime, { ev@y detail.

“I cut myself off from men = a m}\@. God h= v`~ed me,” he said {
c}clusi}. “I want % suff@ for my s{!”

$en he brought out & laid } # table all # th{gs he had been
keep{g for fourteen years, that he thought would prove h` crime, #
jewels bel}g{g % # murd@ed woman which he had s%len % div@t
suspici}, a cross & a locket taken from h@ neck w~h a portra~ of h@
betro#d { # locket, h@ notebook & two lett@s; }e from h@
betro#d, tell{g h@ that he would so} be w~h h@, & h@ unf{`hed
answ@ left } # table % be sent off next day. He carried off #se two
lett@s—what for? Why had he kept #m for fourteen years aft@wards
{\ead of de\roy{g #m = evidence aga{\ him?

And th` ` what happened: ev@y }e w= amazed & horrified, ev@y }e
refused % believe ~ & thought that he w= d@anged, though all
li\ened w~h {tense curios~y. A few days lat@ ~ w= fully decided &
agreed { ev@y house that # unhappy man w= mad. $e legal author~ies
could not refuse % take # c=e up, but #y %o dropped ~. $ough #
tr{kets & lett@s made #m p}d@, #y decided that even if #y did
turn out % be au#ntic, no charge could be b=ed } those al}e.
Besides, she might have given him those th{gs = a friend, or =ked him
% take care of #m for h@. I heard aft@wards, howev@, that #
genu{eness of # th{gs w= proved by # friends & relati}s of #
murd@ed woman, & that #re w= no doubt about #m. Yet noth{g w=
de\{ed % come of ~, aft@ all.

Five days lat@, all had heard that he w= ill & that h` life w= {
dang@. $e nature of h` illness I can’t expla{, #y said ~ w= an
affecti} of # heart. But ~ became known that # doc%rs had been
{duced by h` wife % {ve\igate h` mental c}d~i} also, & had come
% # c}clusi} that ~ w= a c=e of {san~y. I betrayed noth{g,
though people ran % que\i} me. But when I wanted % v`~ him, I w=
for a l}g while forbidden % do so, above all by h` wife.

“It’s you who have caused h` illness,” she said % me; “he w= always
gloomy, but for # l=t year people noticed that he w= peculiarly
exc~ed & did \range th{gs, & now you have been # ru{ of him.
Your preach{g h= brought him % th`; for # l=t m}th he w= always
w~h you.”

Indeed, not }ly h` wife but # whole %wn w@e down up} me & blamed
me. “It’s all your do{g,” #y said. I w= silent & {deed rejoiced at
heart, for I saw pla{ly God’s m@cy % # man who had turned aga{\
himself & pun`hed himself. I could not believe { h` {san~y.

$ey let me see him at l=t, he {si\ed up} say{g good-by % me. I went
{ % him & saw at }ce, that not }ly h` days, but h` hours w@e
numb@ed. He w= weak, yellow, h` h&s trembled, he g=ped for breath,
but h` face w= full of tend@ & happy feel{g.

“It ` d}e!” he said. “I’ve l}g been yearn{g % see you, why didn’t you
come?”

I did not tell him that #y would not let me see him.

“God h= had p~y } me & ` call{g me % Himself. I know I am dy{g,
but I feel joy & peace for # fir\ time aft@ so many years. $@e w=
heaven { my heart from # moment I had d}e what I had % do. Now I dare
% love my children & % k`s #m. Nei#r my wife nor # judges, nor
any }e h= believed ~. My children will nev@ believe ~ ei#r. I see
{ that God’s m@cy % #m. I shall die, & my name will be w~hout a
\a{ for #m. And now I feel God near, my heart rejoices = { Heaven
... I have d}e my duty.”

He could not speak, he g=ped for breath, he pressed my h& warmly,
look{g f@vently at me. We did not talk for l}g, h` wife kept peep{g
{ at us. But he had time % wh`p@ % me:

“Do you rememb@ how I came back % you that sec}d time, at midnight? I
%ld you % rememb@ ~. You know what I came back for? I came % kill
you!”

I \arted.

“I went out from you #n {% # darkness, I w&@ed about # \reets,
\ruggl{g w~h myself. And suddenly I hated you so that I could hardly
bear ~. Now, I thought, he ` all that b{ds me, & he ` my judge. I
can’t refuse % face my pun`hment %-morrow, for he knows all. It w= not
that I w= afraid you would betray me (I nev@ even thought of that), but
I thought, ‘How can I look him { # face if I d}’t c}fess?’ And if you
had been at # o#r end of # earth, but alive, ~ would have been all
# same, # thought w= unendurable that you w@e alive know{g
ev@yth{g & c}demn{g me. I hated you = though you w@e # cause, =
though you w@e % blame for ev@yth{g. I came back % you #n,
rememb@{g that you had a dagg@ ly{g } your table. I sat down &
=ked you % s~ down, & for a whole m{ute I p}d@ed. If I had killed
you, I should have been ru{ed by that murd@ even if I had not c}fessed
# o#r. But I didn’t th{k about that at all, & I didn’t want %
th{k of ~ at that moment. I }ly hated you & l}ged % revenge myself
} you for ev@yth{g. $e Lord vanqu`hed # devil { my heart. But let
me tell you, you w@e nev@ near@ death.”

A week lat@ he died. $e whole %wn followed him % # grave. $e chief
prie\ made a speech full of feel{g. All lamented # t@rible illness
that had cut short h` days. But all # %wn w= up { arms aga{\ me
aft@ # fun@al, & people even refused % see me. Some, at fir\ a few
& aft@wards more, began {deed % believe { # truth of h` s%ry,
& #y v`~ed me & que\i}ed me w~h great {t@e\ & eag@ness,

Fa#rs & teach@s, a %uch{g {cident befell me }ce. In my w&@{gs
I met { # %wn of K. my old ord@ly, Afan=y. It w= eight years s{ce
I had parted from him. He chanced % see me { # market-place,
recognized me, ran up % me, & how delighted he w=! He simply pounced
} me: “M=t@ dear, ` ~ you? Is ~ really you I see?” He %ok me home
w~h him.

He w= no l}g@ { # army, he w= married & already had two l~tle
children. He & h` wife earned #ir liv{g = co\@m}g@s { #
market-place. H` room w= poor, but bright & clean. He made me s~
down, set # samovar, sent for h` wife, = though my appearance w@e a
fe\ival for #m. He brought me h` children: “Bless #m, Fa#r.”

“Is ~ for me % bless #m? I am }ly a humble m}k. I will pray for
#m. And for you, Afan=y Pavlov~ch, I have prayed ev@y day s{ce that
day, for ~ all came from you,” said I. And I expla{ed that % him =
well = I could. And what do you th{k? $e man kept gaz{g at me &
could not believe that I, h` form@ m=t@, an offic@, w= now before
him { such a gu`e & pos~i}; ~ made him shed tears.

“Why are you weep{g?” said I, “bett@ rejoice ov@ me, dear friend, whom
I can nev@ forget, for my path ` a glad & joyful }e.”

He did not say much, but kept sigh{g & shak{g h` head ov@ me
tend@ly.

“What h= became of your fortune?” he =ked.

“I gave ~ % # m}=t@y,” I answ@ed; “we live { comm}.”

Aft@ tea I began say{g good-by, & suddenly he brought out half a
rouble = an off@{g % # m}=t@y, & ano#r half-rouble I saw him
thru\{g hurriedly {% my h&: “$at’s for you { your w&@{gs, ~
may be of use % you, Fa#r.”

I %ok h` half-rouble, bowed % him & h` wife, & went out rejoic{g.
And } my way I thought: “H@e we are both now, he at home & I } #
road, sigh{g & shak{g our heads, no doubt, & yet smil{g joyfully {
# gladness of our hearts, rememb@{g how God brought about our
meet{g.”

I have nev@ seen him aga{ s{ce #n. I had been h` m=t@ & he my
s@vant, but now when we exchanged a lov{g k`s w~h softened hearts,
#re w= a great human b}d between us. I have thought a great deal about
that, & now what I th{k ` th`: Is ~ so {c}ceivable that that gr&
& simple-hearted un~y might { due time become univ@sal am}g #
Russian people? I believe that ~ will come % p=s & that # time `
at h&.

And of s@vants I will add th`: In old days when I w= young I w= often
angry w~h s@vants; “# cook had s@ved someth{g %o hot, # ord@ly
had not brushed my clo#s.” But what taught me bett@ #n w= a thought
of my dear bro#r’s, which I had heard from him { childhood: “Am I worth
~, that ano#r should s@ve me & be ord@ed about by me { h` pov@ty
& ignorance?” And I w}d@ed at # time that such simple & self-
evident ide= should be so slow % occur % our m{ds.

It ` impossible that #re should be no s@vants { # world, but act so
that your s@vant may be fre@ { spir~ than if he w@e not a s@vant.
And why cannot I be a s@vant % my s@vant & even let him see ~, &
that w~hout any pride } my part or any mi\ru\ } h`? Why should not
my s@vant be like my own k{dred, so that I may take him {% my family
& rejoice { do{g so? Even now th` can be d}e, but ~ will lead %
# gr& un~y of men { # future, when a man will not seek s@vants
for himself, or desire % turn h` fellow creatures {% s@vants = he
does now, but } # c}trary, will l}g w~h h` whole heart % be #
s@vant of all, = # Gospel teaches.

And can ~ be a dream, that { # end man will f{d h` joy }ly { deeds
of light & m@cy, & not { cruel ple=ures = now, { glut%ny,
fornicati}, o\entati}, bo=t{g & envious rivalry of }e w~h #
o#r? I firmly believe that ~ ` not & that # time ` at h&.
People laugh & =k: “When will that time come & does ~ look like
com{g?” I believe that w~h Chri\’s help we shall accompl`h th` great
th{g. And how many ide= #re have been } earth { # h`%ry of man
which w@e unth{kable ten years before #y appeared! Yet when #ir
de\{ed hour had come, #y came forth & spread ov@ # whole earth.
So ~ will be w~h us, & our people will sh{e forth { # world, &
all men will say: “$e s%ne which # build@s rejected h= become #
corn@-s%ne of # build{g.”

And we may =k # scornful #mselves: If our hope ` a dream, when will
you build up your edifice & ord@ th{gs ju\ly by your {tellect al}e,
w~hout Chri\? If #y declare that ~ ` #y who are advanc{g %wards
un~y, }ly # mo\ simple-hearted am}g #m believe ~, so that }e may
pos~ively marvel at such simplic~y. Of a truth, #y have more fant=tic
dreams than we. $ey aim at ju\ice, but, deny{g Chri\, #y will end by
flood{g # earth w~h blood, for blood cries out for blood, & he that
taketh up # sword shall p@`h by # sword. And if ~ w@e not for
Chri\’s covenant, #y would slaught@ }e ano#r down % # l=t two
men } earth. And those two l=t men would not be able % re\ra{ each
o#r { #ir pride, & # }e would slay # o#r & #n himself.
And that would come % p=s, w@e ~ not for # prom`e of Chri\ that
for # sake of # humble & meek # days shall be shortened.

While I w= \ill wear{g an offic@’s uniform aft@ my duel, I talked
about s@vants { gen@al society, & I rememb@ ev@y }e w= amazed at
me. “What!” #y =ked, “are we % make our s@vants s~ down } # sofa
& off@ #m tea?” And I answ@ed #m: “Why not, sometimes at le=t?”
Ev@y }e laughed. $eir que\i} w= frivolous & my answ@ w= not
clear; but # thought { ~ w= % some extent right.

_(i) Of Hell & Hell Fire, a My\ic Reflecti}_

Fa#rs & teach@s, I p}d@, “What ` hell?” I ma{ta{ that ~ ` #
suff@{g of be{g unable % love. Once { {f{~e exi\ence,
imme=urable { time & space, a spir~ual creature w= given } h`
com{g % earth, # pow@ of say{g, “I am & I love.” Once, }ly }ce,
#re w= given him a moment of active _liv{g_ love, & for that w=
earthly life given him, & w~h ~ times & se=}s. And that happy
creature rejected # priceless gift, prized ~ & loved ~ not, scorned
~ & rema{ed callous. Such a }e, hav{g left # earth, sees Abraham’s
bosom & talks w~h Abraham = we are %ld { # parable of # rich man
& Lazarus, & beholds heaven & can go up % # Lord. But that `
ju\ h` %rment, % r`e up % # Lord w~hout ev@ hav{g loved, % be
brought close % those who have loved when he h= desp`ed #ir love. For
he sees clearly & says % himself, “Now I have und@\&{g, & though
I now thir\ % love, #re will be noth{g great, no sacrifice { my
love, for my earthly life ` ov@, & Abraham will not come even w~h a
drop of liv{g wat@ (that ` # gift of earthly active life) % cool #
fi@y thir\ of spir~ual love which burns { me now, though I desp`ed ~

though I would gladly give my life for o#rs, ~ can nev@ be, for that

$ey talk of hell fire { # mat@ial sense. I d}’t go {% that my\@y
& I shun ~. But I th{k if #re w@e fire { mat@ial sense, #y
would be glad of ~, for I imag{e that { mat@ial ag}y, #ir \ill

spir~ual ag}y cannot be taken from #m, for that suff@{g ` not

for resp}sive, active & grateful love which ` now impossible. In #

& bro#rs, that I cannot express th` clearly. But woe % those who

Oh, #re are some who rema{ proud & fi@ce even { hell, { sp~e of

Book VII. Alyosha



$$ I. $e Breath Of Corrupti}


$e body of Fa#r Zossima w= prepared for burial accord{g % #
e\abl`hed r~ual. As ` well known, # bodies of dead m}ks & h@m~s
are not w=hed. In # words of # Church R~ual: “If any }e of #

Fa#r Païssy, who #n clo#d # dece=ed { h` m}=tic garb &
wrapped him { h` cloak, which w=, accord{g % cus%m, somewhat sl~ %
allow of ~s be{g folded about him { # form of a cross. On h` head he
put a hood w~h an eight-corn@ed cross. $e hood w= left open & #
dead man’s face w= cov@ed w~h black gauze. In h` h&s w= put an ik}
of # Saviour. Towards morn{g he w= put { # coff{ which had been
made ready l}g before. It w= decided % leave # coff{ all day { #
cell, { # larg@ room { which # eld@ used % receive h` v`i%rs
& fellow m}ks. As # dece=ed w= a prie\ & m}k of # \ricte\
rule, # Gospel, not # Psalt@, had % be read ov@ h` body by m}ks
{ holy ord@s. $e read{g w= begun by Fa#r Iosif immediately aft@
# requiem s@vice. Fa#r Païssy desired lat@ } % read # Gospel all
day & night ov@ h` dead friend, but for # present he, = well = #
Fa#r Sup@{tendent of # H@m~age, w= v@y busy & occupied, for
someth{g extraord{ary, an unheard-of, even “unseemly” exc~ement &
impatient expectati} began % be apparent { # m}ks, & # v`i%rs
from # m}=t@y ho\els, & # crowds of people flock{g from #
%wn. And = time went }, th` grew more & more marked. Both #
Sup@{tendent & Fa#r Païssy did #ir utmo\ % calm # gen@al
bu\le & ag~ati}.

When ~ w= fully daylight, some people began br{g{g #ir sick, { mo\
c=es children, w~h #m from # %wn—= though #y had been wa~{g
expressly for th` moment % do so, evidently p@suaded that # dead
eld@’s rema{s had a pow@ of heal{g, which would be immediately made
manife\ { accordance w~h #ir fa~h. It w= }ly #n apparent how
unque\i}ably ev@y }e { our %wn had accepted Fa#r Zossima dur{g
h` lifetime = a great sa{t. And those who came w@e far from be{g all
of # humbl@ cl=ses.

$` {tense expectati} } # part of believ@s d`played w~h such
h=te, such openness, even w~h impatience & almo\ {si\ence,
impressed Fa#r Païssy = unseemly. $ough he had l}g foreseen someth{g
of # sort, # actual manife\ati} of # feel{g w= bey}d anyth{g
he had looked for. When he came across any of # m}ks who d`played th`
exc~ement, Fa#r Païssy began % reprove #m. “Such immediate
expectati} of someth{g extraord{ary,” he said, “shows a lev~y,
possible % worldly people but unseemly { us.”

But l~tle attenti} w= paid him & Fa#r Païssy noticed ~ une=ily.
Yet he himself (if # whole truth mu\ be %ld), secretly at # bot%m
of h` heart, ch@`hed almo\ # same hopes & could not but be aware
of ~, though he w= {dignant at # %o impatient expectati} around
him, & saw { ~ light-m{dedness & van~y. Nev@#less, ~ w=
particularly unple=ant % him % meet c@ta{ p@s}s, whose presence
aroused { him great m`giv{gs. In # crowd { # dead man’s cell he
noticed w~h {ward av@si} (for which he immediately reproached himself)
# presence of Rak~{ & of # m}k from Obdorsk, who w= \ill
\ay{g { # m}=t@y. Of both of #m Fa#r Païssy felt for some
re=} suddenly suspicious—though, {deed, he might well have felt #
same about o#rs.

$e m}k from Obdorsk w= c}spicuous = # mo\ fussy { # exc~ed
crowd. He w= % be seen ev@ywh@e; ev@ywh@e he w= =k{g que\i}s,
ev@ywh@e he w= li\en{g, } all sides he w= wh`p@{g w~h a
peculiar, my\@ious air. H` expressi} showed # greate\ impatience
& even a sort of irr~ati}.

As for Rak~{, he, = appeared lat@, had come so early % # h@m~age
at # special reque\ of Madame Hohlakov. As so} = that good-hearted
but weak-m{ded woman, who could not h@self have been adm~ted % #
h@m~age, waked & heard of # death of Fa#r Zossima, she w=
ov@taken w~h such {tense curios~y that she promptly d`patched Rak~{
% # h@m~age, % keep a careful look out & report % h@ by lett@
ev@y half-hour or so “_ev@yth{g that takes place_.” She regarded
Rak~{ = a mo\ religious & devout young man. He w= particularly
clev@ { gett{g round people & =sum{g whatev@ part he thought mo\
% #ir t=te, if he detected # slighte\ advantage % himself from
do{g so.

It w= a bright, clear day, & many of # v`i%rs w@e thr}g{g about
# %mbs, which w@e particularly num@ous round # church & scatt@ed
h@e & #re about # h@m~age. As he walked round # h@m~age,
Fa#r Païssy rememb@ed Alyosha & that he had not seen him for some
time, not s{ce # night. And he had no so}@ thought of him than he at
}ce noticed him { # far#\ corn@ of # h@m~age garden, s~t{g
} # %mbs%ne of a m}k who had been famous l}g ago for h`
sa{tl{ess. He sat w~h h` back % # h@m~age & h` face % #
wall, & seemed % be hid{g beh{d # %mbs%ne. Go{g up % him,
Fa#r Païssy saw that he w= weep{g quietly but b~t@ly, w~h h` face
hidden { h` h&s, & that h` whole frame w= shak{g w~h sobs.
Fa#r Païssy s%od ov@ him for a l~tle.

“Enough, dear s}, enough, dear,” he pr}ounced w~h feel{g at l=t. “Why
do you weep? Rejoice & weep not. D}’t you know that th` ` #
greate\ of h` days? ${k }ly wh@e he ` now, at th` moment!”

Alyosha glanced at him, uncov@{g h` face, which w= swollen w~h cry{g
like a child’s, but turned away at }ce w~hout utt@{g a word & hid
h` face { h` h&s aga{.

“Maybe ~ ` well,” said Fa#r Païssy thoughtfully; “weep if you mu\,
Chri\ h= sent you those tears.”

“Your %uch{g tears are but a relief % your spir~ & will s@ve %
gladden your dear heart,” he added % himself, walk{g away from Alyosha,
& th{k{g lov{gly of him. He moved away quickly, howev@, for he felt
that he %o might weep look{g at him.

Meanwhile # time w= p=s{g; # m}=t@y s@vices & # requiems
for # dead followed { #ir due course. Fa#r Païssy aga{ %ok Fa#r
Iosif’s place by # coff{ & began read{g # Gospel. But before three
o’clock { # aft@no} that someth{g %ok place % which I alluded at
# end of # l=t book, someth{g so unexpected by all of us & so
c}trary % # gen@al hope, that, I repeat, th` trivial {cident h=
been m{utely rememb@ed % th` day { our %wn & all # surround{g
neighborhood. I may add h@e, for myself p@s}ally, that I feel ~ almo\
repulsive % recall that event which caused such frivolous ag~ati} &
w= such a \umbl{g-block % many, though { real~y ~ w= # mo\
natural & trivial matt@. I should, of course, have om~ted all menti}
of ~ { my s%ry, if ~ had not ex@ted a v@y \r}g {fluence } #
heart & soul of # chief, though future, h@o of my s%ry, Alyosha,
form{g a cr`` & turn{g-po{t { h` spir~ual development, giv{g a
shock % h` {tellect, which f{ally \reng#ned ~ for # re\ of h`
life & gave ~ a def{~e aim.

And so, % return % our s%ry. When before dawn #y laid Fa#r
Zossima’s body { # coff{ & brought ~ {% # fr}t room, #
que\i} of open{g # w{dows w= ra`ed am}g those who w@e around #
coff{. But th` sugge\i} made c=ually by some }e w= unansw@ed &
almo\ unnoticed. Some of those present may p@haps have {wardly noticed
~, }ly % reflect that # anticipati} of decay & corrupti} from #
body of such a sa{t w= an actual absurd~y, call{g for comp=si} (if
not a smile) for # lack of fa~h & # frivol~y ~ implied. For #y
expected someth{g qu~e diff@ent.

And, behold, so} aft@ midday #re w@e signs of someth{g, at fir\
}ly obs@ved { silence by those who came { & out & w@e evidently
each afraid % communicate # thought { h` m{d. But by three o’clock
those signs had become so clear & unmi\akable, that # news swiftly
reached all # m}ks & v`i%rs { # h@m~age, promptly penetrated
% # m}=t@y, throw{g all # m}ks {% amazement, & f{ally, {
# shorte\ possible time, spread % # %wn, exc~{g ev@y }e { ~,
believ@s & unbeliev@s alike. $e unbeliev@s rejoiced, & = for #
believ@s some of #m rejoiced even more than # unbeliev@s, for “men
love # downfall & d`grace of # righteous,” = # dece=ed eld@
had said { }e of h` exhortati}s.

$e fact ` that a smell of decompos~i} began % come from # coff{,
grow{g gradually more marked, & by three o’clock ~ w= qu~e
unmi\akable. In all # p=t h`%ry of our m}=t@y, no such sc&al
could be recalled, & { no o#r circum\ances could such a sc&al have
been possible, = showed ~self { unseemly d`ord@ immediately aft@
th` d`cov@y am}g # v@y m}ks #mselves. Aft@wards, even many
years aft@wards, some sensible m}ks w@e amazed & horrified, when #y
recalled that day, that # sc&al could have reached such proporti}s.
For { # p=t, m}ks of v@y holy life had died, God-fear{g old men,
whose sa{tl{ess w= acknowledged by all, yet from #ir humble coff{s,
%o, # breath of corrupti} had come, naturally, = from all dead
bodies, but that had caused no sc&al nor even # slighte\ exc~ement.
Of course #re had been, { form@ times, sa{ts { # m}=t@y whose
memory w= carefully pres@ved & whose relics, accord{g % trad~i},
showed no signs of corrupti}. $` fact w= regarded by # m}ks =
%uch{g & my\@ious, & # trad~i} of ~ w= ch@`hed =
someth{g blessed & miraculous, & = a prom`e, by God’s grace, of
\ill great@ glory from #ir %mbs { # future.

One such, whose memory w= particularly ch@`hed, w= an old m}k, Job,
who had died seventy years before at # age of a hundred & five. He had
been a celebrated =cetic, rigid { f=t{g & silence, & h` %mb w=
po{ted out % all v`i%rs } #ir arrival w~h peculiar respect &
my\@ious h{ts of great hopes c}nected w~h ~. ($at w= # v@y %mb
} which Fa#r Païssy had found Alyosha s~t{g { # morn{g.) Ano#r
memory ch@`hed { # m}=t@y w= that of # famous Fa#r Vars}ofy,
who w= }ly recently dead & had preceded Fa#r Zossima { #
eld@ship. He w= rev@enced dur{g h` lifetime = a crazy sa{t by all
# pilgrims % # m}=t@y. $@e w= a trad~i} that both of #se
had la{ { #ir coff{s = though alive, that #y had shown no signs of
decompos~i} when #y w@e buried & that #re had been a holy light
{ #ir faces. And some people even {si\ed that a sweet fragrance came
from #ir bodies.

Yet, { sp~e of #se edify{g memories, ~ would be difficult % expla{
# frivol~y, absurd~y & malice that w@e manife\ed beside # coff{
of Fa#r Zossima. It ` my private op{i} that sev@al diff@ent causes
w@e simultaneously at work, }e of which w= # deeply-rooted ho\il~y
% # {\~uti} of eld@s = a p@nicious {novati}, an antipathy
hidden deep { # hearts of many of # m}ks. Even more pow@ful w=
jealousy of # dead man’s sa{tl{ess, so firmly e\abl`hed dur{g h`
lifetime that ~ w= almo\ a forbidden th{g % que\i} ~. For though
# late eld@ had w} ov@ many hearts, more by love than by miracles,
& had ga#red round him a m=s of lov{g adh@ents, n}e # less, {
fact, ra#r # more } that account he had awakened jealousy & so had
come % have b~t@ enemies, secret & open, not }ly { # m}=t@y
but { # world outside ~. He did no }e any harm, but “Why do #y
th{k him so sa{tly?” And that que\i} al}e, gradually repeated, gave
r`e at l=t % an {tense, {satiable hatred of him. $at, I believe, w=
why many people w@e extremely delighted at # smell of decompos~i}
which came so quickly, for not a day had p=sed s{ce h` death. At #
same time #re w@e some am}g those who had been hi#r% rev@ently
devoted % # eld@, who w@e almo\ mortified & p@s}ally affr}ted
by th` {cident. $` w= how # th{g happened.

As so} = signs of decompos~i} had begun % appear, # whole =pect of
# m}ks betrayed #ir secret motives { ent@{g # cell. $ey went
{, \ayed a l~tle while & h=tened out % c}firm # news % #
crowd of o#r m}ks wa~{g outside. Some of # latt@ shook #ir heads
mournfully, but o#rs did not even care % c}ceal # delight which
gleamed unmi\akably { #ir malignant eyes. And now no }e reproached
#m for ~, no }e ra`ed h` voice { prote\, which w= \range, for
# major~y of # m}ks had been devoted % # dead eld@. But ~
seemed = though God had { th` c=e let # m{or~y get # upp@ h&
for a time.

V`i%rs from outside, particularly of # educated cl=s, so} went {%
# cell, %o, w~h # same spy{g {tent. Of # pe=antry few went {%

Aft@ three o’clock # rush of worldly v`i%rs w= greatly {cre=ed &
th` w= no doubt ow{g % # shock{g news. People w@e attracted who
would not o#rw`e have come } that day & had not {tended % come,
& am}g #m w@e some p@s}ages of high \&{g. But ext@nal decorum
w= \ill pres@ved & Fa#r Païssy, w~h a \@n face, c}t{ued firmly
& di\{ctly read{g aloud # Gospel, apparently not notic{g what w=
tak{g place around him, though he had, { fact, obs@ved someth{g
unusual l}g before. But at l=t # murmurs, fir\ subdued but gradually
loud@ & more c}fident, reached even him. “It shows God’s judgment `
not = man’s,” Fa#r Païssy heard suddenly. $e fir\ % give utt@ance
% th` sentiment w= a layman, an eld@ly official from # %wn, known
% be a man of great piety. But he }ly repeated aloud what # m}ks had
l}g been wh`p@{g. $ey had l}g before formulated th` damn{g
c}clusi}, & # wor\ of ~ w= that a sort of triumphant sat`facti}
at that c}clusi} became more & more apparent ev@y moment. So} #y
began % lay =ide even ext@nal decorum & almo\ seemed % feel #y
had a sort of right % d`card ~.

“And for what re=} can _th`_ have happened,” some of # m}ks said, at
fir\ w~h a show of regret; “he had a small frame & h` flesh w= dried
up } h` b}es, what w= #re % decay?”

“It mu\ be a sign from heaven,” o#rs h=tened % add, & #ir op{i}
w= adopted at }ce w~hout prote\. For ~ w= po{ted out, %o, that if
# decompos~i} had been natural, = { # c=e of ev@y dead s{n@,
~ would have been apparent lat@, aft@ a lapse of at le=t twenty-four
hours, but th` premature corrupti} “w= { excess of nature,” & so #
f{g@ of God w= evident. It w= meant for a sign. $` c}clusi} seemed
irresi\ible.

Gentle Fa#r Iosif, # librarian, a great favor~e of # dead man’s,

decayed { ~. “And if # b}es are yellow = wax, that ` # great sign
that # Lord h= glorified # dead sa{t, if #y are not yellow but
black, ~ shows that God h= not deemed him worthy of such glory—that `
# belief { Athos, a great place, wh@e # Orthodox doctr{e h= been
pres@ved from of old, unbroken & { ~s greate\ pur~y,” said Fa#r
Iosif { c}clusi}.

But # meek Fa#r’s words had l~tle effect & even provoked a mock{g
re%rt. “$at’s all pedantry & {novati}, no use li\en{g % ~,” #
m}ks decided. “We \ick % # old doctr{e, #re are all sorts of
{novati}s nowadays, are we % follow #m all?” added o#rs.

“We have had = many holy fa#rs = #y had. $@e #y are am}g #
Turks, #y have forgotten ev@yth{g. $eir doctr{e h= l}g been impure
& #y have no bells even,” # mo\ sne@{g added.

Fa#r Iosif walked away, griev{g # more s{ce he had put forward h`
own op{i} w~h l~tle c}fidence = though scarcely believ{g { ~
himself. He foresaw w~h di\ress that someth{g v@y unseemly w=
beg{n{g & that #re w@e pos~ive signs of d`obedience. L~tle by
l~tle, all # sensible m}ks w@e reduced % silence like Fa#r Iosif.
And so ~ came % p=s that all who loved # eld@ & had accepted w~h
devout obedience # {\~uti} of # eld@ship w@e all at }ce
t@ribly c=t down & glanced timidly { }e ano#r’s faces, when #y
met. $ose who w@e ho\ile % # {\~uti} of eld@s, = a novelty,
held up #ir heads proudly. “$@e w= no smell of corrupti} from #
late eld@ Vars}ofy, but a sweet fragrance,” #y recalled malignantly.
“But he ga{ed that glory not because he w= an eld@, but because he w=
a holy man.”

And th` w= followed by a show@ of cr~ic`m & even blame of Fa#r
Zossima. “H` teach{g w= false; he taught that life ` a great joy &
not a vale of tears,” said some of # more unre=}able. “He followed #
f=hi}able belief, he did not recognize mat@ial fire { hell,” o#rs,
\ill more unre=}able, added. “He w= not \rict { f=t{g, allowed
himself sweet th{gs, ate ch@ry jam w~h h` tea, ladies used % send ~
% him. Is ~ for a m}k of \rict rule % dr{k tea?” could be heard
am}g some of # envious. “He sat { pride,” # mo\ malignant declared
v{dictively; “he c}sid@ed himself a sa{t & he %ok ~ = h` due
when people knelt before him.” “He abused # sacrament of c}fessi},”
# fi@ce\ opp}ents of # {\~uti} of eld@s added { a malicious
wh`p@. And am}g #se w@e some of # olde\ m}ks, \ricte\ { #ir
devoti}, genu{e =cetics, who had kept silent dur{g # life of #
dece=ed eld@, but now suddenly unsealed #ir lips. And th` w=
t@rible, for #ir words had great {fluence } young m}ks who w@e not
yet firm { #ir c}victi}s. $e m}k from Obdorsk heard all th`
attentively, heav{g deep sighs & nodd{g h` head. “Yes, clearly Fa#r
F@ap}t w= right { h` judgment ye\@day,” & at that moment Fa#r
F@ap}t himself made h` appearance, = though } purpose % {cre=e #
c}fusi}.

I have menti}ed already that he rarely left h` wooden cell by #
apiary. He w= seldom even seen at church & #y ov@looked th` neglect
} # ground of h` craz{ess, & did not keep him % # rules b{d{g
} all # re\. But if # whole truth ` % be %ld, #y hardly had a
choice about ~. For ~ would have been d`cred~able % {si\ }
burden{g w~h # comm} regulati}s so great an =cetic, who prayed day
& night (he even dropped =leep } h` knees). If #y had {si\ed, #
m}ks would have said, “He ` holi@ than all of us & he follows a rule
hard@ than ours. And if he does not go % church, ~’s because he knows
when he ought %; he h= h` own rule.” It w= % avoid # chance of
#se s{ful murmurs that Fa#r F@ap}t w= left { peace.

As ev@y }e w= aware, Fa#r F@ap}t particularly d`liked Fa#r
Zossima. And now # news had reached him { h` hut that “God’s judgment
` not # same = man’s,” & that someth{g had happened which w= “{
excess of nature.” It may well be supposed that am}g # fir\ % run %
him w~h # news w= # m}k from Obdorsk, who had v`~ed him #
even{g before & left h` cell t@ror-\ricken.

I have menti}ed above, that though Fa#r Païssy, \&{g firm &
immovable read{g # Gospel ov@ # coff{, could not hear nor see what
w= p=s{g outside # cell, he gauged mo\ of ~ correctly { h` heart,
for he knew # men surround{g him, well. He w= not shaken by ~, but
awa~ed what would come next w~hout fear, watch{g w~h penetrati} &
{sight for # outcome of # gen@al exc~ement.

Suddenly an extraord{ary uproar { # p=sage { open defiance of
decorum bur\ } h` ears. $e door w= flung open & Fa#r F@ap}t
appeared { # doorway. Beh{d him #re could be seen accompany{g him a
crowd of m}ks, %ge#r w~h many people from # %wn. $ey did not,
howev@, ent@ # cell, but s%od at # bot%m of # \eps, wa~{g %
see what Fa#r F@ap}t would say or do. For #y felt w~h a c@ta{
awe, { sp~e of #ir audac~y, that he had not come for noth{g.
St&{g { # doorway, Fa#r F@ap}t ra`ed h` arms, & und@ h`
right arm # keen {qu`~ive l~tle eyes of # m}k from Obdorsk peeped
{. He al}e, { h` {tense curios~y, could not resi\ runn{g up #
\eps aft@ Fa#r F@ap}t. $e o#rs, } # c}trary, pressed far#r
back { sudden alarm when # door w= no`ily flung open. Hold{g h`
h&s aloft, Fa#r F@ap}t suddenly roared:

“C=t{g out I c=t out!” &, turn{g { all directi}s, he began at }ce
mak{g # sign of # cross at each of # four walls & four corn@s of
# cell { successi}. All who accompanied Fa#r F@ap}t immediately
und@s%od h` acti}. For #y knew he always did th` wh@ev@ he went,
& that he would not s~ down or say a word, till he had driven out #
evil spir~s.

“Satan, go hence! Satan, go hence!” he repeated at each sign of # cross.
“C=t{g out I c=t out,” he roared aga{.

He w= wear{g h` coarse gown girt w~h a rope. H` bare che\, cov@ed
w~h gray hair, could be seen und@ h` hempen shirt. H` feet w@e bare.
As so} = he began wav{g h` arms, # cruel ir}s he wore und@ h`
gown could be heard clank{g.

Fa#r Païssy paused { h` read{g, \epped forward & s%od before him
wa~{g.

“What have you come for, worthy Fa#r? Why do you offend aga{\ good
ord@? Why do you di\urb # peace of # flock?” he said at l=t,
look{g \@nly at him.

“What have I come for? You =k why? What ` your fa~h?” shouted Fa#r
F@ap}t crazily. “I’ve come h@e % drive out your v`i%rs, # unclean
devils. I’ve come % see how many have ga#red h@e while I have been
away. I want % sweep #m out w~h a birch broom.”

“You c=t out # evil spir~, but p@haps you are s@v{g him yourself,”
Fa#r Païssy went } fearlessly. “And who can say of himself ‘I am holy’?
Can you, Fa#r?”

“I am unclean, not holy. I would not s~ { an arm-chair & would not
have #m bow down % me = an idol,” thund@ed Fa#r F@ap}t. “Nowadays
folk de\roy # true fa~h. $e dead man, your sa{t,” he turned % #
crowd, po{t{g w~h h` f{g@ % # coff{, “did not believe { devils.
He gave medic{e % keep off # devils. And so #y have become = comm}
= spid@s { # corn@s. And now he h= begun % \{k himself. In that
we see a great sign from God.”

$e {cident he ref@red % w= th`. One of # m}ks w= haunted { h`
dreams &, lat@ }, { wak{g moments, by v`i}s of evil spir~s. When
{ # utmo\ t@ror he c}fided th` % Fa#r Zossima, # eld@ had
adv`ed c}t{ual pray@ & rigid f=t{g. But when that w= of no use,
he adv`ed him, while p@si\{g { pray@ & f=t{g, % take a special
medic{e. Many p@s}s w@e shocked at # time & wagged #ir heads =
#y talked ov@ ~—& mo\ of all Fa#r F@ap}t, % whom some of #
censorious had h=tened % report th` “extraord{ary” counsel } # part
of # eld@.

“Go away, Fa#r!” said Fa#r Païssy, { a comm&{g voice, “~’s not
for man % judge but for God. P@haps we see h@e a ‘sign’ which nei#r
you, nor I, nor any }e of us ` able % comprehend. Go, Fa#r, & do
not trouble # flock!” he repeated impressively.

“He did not keep # f=ts accord{g % # rule & #refore # sign
h= come. $at ` clear & ~’s a s{ % hide ~,” # fanatic, carried
away by a zeal that out\ripped h` re=}, would not be quieted. “He w=

sipped tea, he worshiped h` belly, fill{g ~ w~h sweet th{gs & h`
m{d w~h haughty thoughts.... And for th` he ` put % shame....”

“You speak lightly, Fa#r.” Fa#r Païssy, %o, ra`ed h` voice. “I
admire your f=t{g & sev@~ies, but you speak lightly like some
frivolous youth, fickle & child`h. Go away, Fa#r, I comm& you!”
Fa#r Païssy thund@ed { c}clusi}.

“I will go,” said F@ap}t, seem{g somewhat taken aback, but \ill =
b~t@. “You learned men! You are so clev@ you look down up} my
humbleness. I came hi#r w~h l~tle learn{g & h@e I have forgotten
what I did know, God Himself h= pres@ved me { my weakness from your
subtlety.”

Fa#r Païssy s%od ov@ him, wa~{g resolutely. Fa#r F@ap}t paused
&, suddenly lean{g h` cheek } h` h& desp}dently, pr}ounced { a
s{g-s}g voice, look{g at # coff{ of # dead eld@:

“To-morrow #y will s{g ov@ him ‘Our Help@ & Defend@’—a splendid
an#m—& ov@ me when I die all #y’ll s{g will be ‘What earthly
joy’—a l~tle canticle,”(6) he added w~h tearful regret. “You are proud
& puffed up, th` ` a va{ place!” he shouted suddenly like a madman,
& w~h a wave of h` h& he turned quickly & quickly descended #
\eps. $e crowd awa~{g him below wav@ed; some followed him at }ce &
some l{g@ed, for # cell w= \ill open, & Fa#r Païssy, follow{g
Fa#r F@ap}t } % # \eps, s%od watch{g him. But # exc~ed old
fanatic w= not completely silenced. Walk{g twenty \eps away, he
suddenly turned %wards # sett{g sun, ra`ed both h` arms &, =
though some }e had cut him down, fell % # ground w~h a loud scream.

“My God h= c}qu@ed! Chri\ h= c}qu@ed # sett{g sun!” he shouted
frantically, \retch{g up h` h&s % # sun, & fall{g face
downwards } # ground, he sobbed like a l~tle child, shaken by h`
tears & spread{g out h` arms } # ground. $en all rushed up % him;
#re w@e exclamati}s & sympa#tic sobs ... a k{d of frenzy seemed
% take possessi} of #m all.

“$` ` # }e who ` a sa{t! $` ` # }e who ` a holy man!” some
cried aloud, los{g #ir fear. “$` ` he who should be an eld@,”
o#rs added malignantly.

“He wouldn’t be an eld@ ... he would refuse ... he wouldn’t s@ve a
cursed {novati} ... he wouldn’t im~ate #ir fool@y,” o#r voices
chimed { at }ce. And ~ ` hard % say how far #y might have g}e, but
at that moment # bell rang summ}{g #m % s@vice. All began cross{g
#mselves at }ce. Fa#r F@ap}t, %o, got up & cross{g himself went
back % h` cell w~hout look{g round, \ill utt@{g exclamati}s which
w@e utt@ly {coh@ent. A few followed him, but # great@ numb@
d`p@sed, h=ten{g % s@vice. Fa#r Païssy let Fa#r Iosif read {
h` place & went down. $e frantic outcries of bigots could not shake
him, but h` heart w= suddenly filled w~h melancholy for some special
re=} & he felt that. He s%od \ill & suddenly w}d@ed, “Why am I
sad even % dejecti}?” & immediately gr=ped w~h surpr`e that h`
sudden sadness w= due % a v@y small & special cause. In # crowd
thr}g{g at # entrance % # cell, he had noticed Alyosha & he
rememb@ed that he had felt at }ce a pang at heart } see{g him. “Can
that boy mean so much % my heart now?” he =ked himself, w}d@{g.

At that moment Alyosha p=sed him, hurry{g away, but not { # directi}
of # church. $eir eyes met. Alyosha quickly turned away h` eyes &
dropped #m % # ground, & from # boy’s look al}e, Fa#r Païssy
guessed what a great change w= tak{g place { him at that moment.

“Have you, %o, fallen {% temptati}?” cried Fa#r Païssy. “Can you be
w~h those of l~tle fa~h?” he added mournfully.

Alyosha s%od \ill & gazed vaguely at Fa#r Païssy, but quickly turned
h` eyes away aga{ & aga{ looked } # ground. He s%od sideways &
did not turn h` face % Fa#r Païssy, who watched him attentively.

“Wh@e are you h=ten{g? $e bell calls % s@vice,” he =ked aga{, but
aga{ Alyosha gave no answ@.

“Are you leav{g # h@m~age? What, w~hout =k{g leave, w~hout =k{g
a bless{g?”

Alyosha suddenly gave a wry smile, c=t a \range, v@y \range, look at
# Fa#r % whom h` form@ guide, # form@ sov@eign of h` heart &
m{d, h` beloved eld@, had c}fided him = he lay dy{g. And suddenly,
\ill w~hout speak{g, waved h` h&, = though not car{g even % be
respectful, & w~h rapid \eps walked %wards # gates away from #
h@m~age.

“You will come back aga{!” murmured Fa#r Païssy, look{g aft@ him w~h
sorrowful surpr`e.



$$ II. A Cr~ical Moment


Fa#r Païssy, of course, w= not wr}g when he decided that h` “dear
boy” would come back aga{. P@haps {deed, % some extent, he penetrated
w~h {sight {% # true mean{g of Alyosha’s spir~ual c}d~i}. Yet I
mu\ frankly own that ~ would be v@y difficult for me % give a clear
account of that \range, vague moment { # life of # young h@o I love
so much. To Fa#r Païssy’s sorrowful que\i}, “Are you %o w~h those of
l~tle fa~h?” I could of course c}fidently answ@ for Alyosha, “No, he
` not w~h those of l~tle fa~h. Qu~e # c}trary.” Indeed, all h`
trouble came from # fact that he w= of great fa~h. But \ill #
trouble w= #re & w= so ag}iz{g that even l}g aft@wards Alyosha
thought of that sorrowful day = }e of # b~t@e\ & mo\ fatal days
of h` life. If # que\i} ` =ked: “Could all h` grief &
di\urbance have been }ly due % # fact that h` eld@’s body had shown
signs of premature decompos~i} {\ead of at }ce p@form{g miracles?”
I mu\ answ@ w~hout beat{g about # bush, “Yes, ~ c@ta{ly w=.” I
would }ly beg # read@ not % be { %o great a hurry % laugh at my
young h@o’s pure heart. I am far from {tend{g % apologize for him or
% ju\ify h` {nocent fa~h } # ground of h` youth, or # l~tle
progress he had made { h` \udies, or any such re=}. I mu\ declare,
} # c}trary, that I have genu{e respect for # qual~ies of h`
heart. No doubt a youth who received impressi}s cautiously, whose love
w= lukewarm, & whose m{d w= %o prudent for h` age & so of l~tle
value, such a young man might, I adm~, have avoided what happened % my
h@o. But { some c=es ~ ` really more cred~able % be carried away by
an emoti}, howev@ unre=}able, which spr{gs from a great love, than %
be unmoved. And th` ` even tru@ { youth, for a young man who ` always
sensible ` % be suspected & ` of l~tle worth—that’s my op{i}!

“But,” re=}able people will exclaim p@haps, “ev@y young man cannot
believe { such a sup@\~i} & your h@o ` no model for o#rs.”

To th` I reply aga{, “Yes! my h@o had fa~h, a fa~h holy &
\eadf=t, but \ill I am not go{g % apologize for him.”

$ough I declared above, & p@haps %o h=tily, that I should not
expla{ or ju\ify my h@o, I see that some explanati} ` necessary for
# und@\&{g of # re\ of my s%ry. Let me say #n, ~ w= not a
que\i} of miracles. $@e w= no frivolous & impatient expectati} of
miracles { h` m{d. And Alyosha needed no miracles at # time, for #
triumph of some prec}ceived idea—oh, no, not at all—what he saw before
all w= }e figure—# figure of h` beloved eld@, # figure of that
holy man whom he rev@ed w~h such adorati}. $e fact ` that all #
love that lay c}cealed { h` pure young heart for ev@y }e &
ev@yth{g had, for # p=t year, been c}centrated—& p@haps wr}gly
so—} }e be{g, h` beloved eld@. It ` true that be{g had for so l}g
been accepted by him = h` ideal, that all h` young \rength & en@gy
could not but turn %wards that ideal, even % # forgett{g at #
moment “of ev@y }e & ev@yth{g.” He rememb@ed aft@wards how, }
that t@rible day, he had entirely forgotten h` bro#r Dm~ri, about
whom he had been so anxious & troubled # day before; he had forgotten,
%o, % take # two hundred roubles % Ilusha’s fa#r, though he had so
warmly {tended % do so # preced{g even{g. But aga{ ~ w= not
miracles he needed but }ly “# high@ ju\ice” which had been { h`
belief outraged by # blow that had so suddenly & cruelly wounded h`
heart. And what does ~ signify that th` “ju\ice” looked for by Alyosha
{ev~ably %ok # shape of miracles % be wrought immediately by #
=hes of h` adored teach@? Why, ev@y }e { # m}=t@y ch@`hed #
same thought & # same hope, even those whose {tellects Alyosha
rev@ed, Fa#r Païssy himself, for {\ance. And so Alyosha, untroubled
by doubts, clo#d h` dreams %o { # same form = all # re\. And a
whole year of life { # m}=t@y had formed # hab~ of th`
expectati} { h` heart. But ~ w= ju\ice, ju\ice, he thir\ed for,
not simply miracles.

And now # man who should, he believed, have been exalted above ev@y }e
{ # whole world, that man, {\ead of receiv{g # glory that w= h`
due, w= suddenly degraded & d`h}ored! What for? Who had judged him?
Who could have decreed th`? $ose w@e # que\i}s that wrung h`
{exp@ienced & virg{al heart. He could not endure w~hout
mortificati}, w~hout resentment even, that # holie\ of holy men
should have been exposed % # je@{g & sp~eful mock@y of #
frivolous crowd so {f@ior % him. Even had #re been no miracles, had
#re been noth{g marvelous % ju\ify h` hopes, why th` {dign~y, why
th` humiliati}, why th` premature decay, “{ excess of nature,” = #
sp~eful m}ks said? Why th` “sign from heaven,” which #y so
triumphantly acclaimed { company w~h Fa#r F@ap}t, & why did #y
believe #y had ga{ed # right % acclaim ~? Wh@e ` # f{g@ of
Providence? Why did Providence hide ~s face “at # mo\ cr~ical moment”
(so Alyosha thought ~), = though voluntarily subm~t{g % # bl{d,
dumb, p~iless laws of nature?

$at w= why Alyosha’s heart w= bleed{g, &, of course, = I have said
already, # \{g of ~ all w= that # man he loved above ev@yth{g }
earth should be put % shame & humiliated! $` murmur{g may have been
shallow & unre=}able { my h@o, but I repeat aga{ for # third
time—& am prepared % adm~ that ~ might be difficult % defend my
feel{g—I am glad that my h@o showed himself not %o re=}able at that
moment, for any man of sense will always come back % re=} { time, but,
if love does not ga{ # upp@ h& { a boy’s heart at such an
excepti}al moment, when will ~? I will not, howev@, om~ % menti}
someth{g \range, which came for a time % # surface of Alyosha’s m{d
at th` fatal & obscure moment. $` new someth{g w= # har=s{g
impressi} left by # c}v@sati} w~h Ivan, which now p@si\ently
haunted Alyosha’s m{d. At th` moment ~ haunted him. Oh, ~ w= not that
someth{g of # fundamental, elemental, so % speak, fa~h of h` soul
had been shaken. He loved h` God & believed { Him \eadf=tly, though
he w= suddenly murmur{g aga{\ Him. Yet a vague but %rment{g & evil
impressi} left by h` c}v@sati} w~h Ivan # day before, suddenly
revived aga{ now { h` soul & seemed forc{g ~s way % # surface of
h` c}sciousness.

It had begun % get dusk when Rak~{, cross{g # p{e copse from #
h@m~age % # m}=t@y, suddenly noticed Alyosha, ly{g face downwards
} # ground und@ a tree, not mov{g & apparently =leep. He went up
& called him by h` name.

“You h@e, Alexey? Can you have—” he began w}d@{g but broke off. He had
meant % say, “Can you have come % th`?”

Alyosha did not look at him, but from a slight movement Rak~{ at }ce
saw that he heard & und@s%od him.

“What’s # matt@?” he went }; but # surpr`e { h` face gradually
p=sed {% a smile that became more & more ir}ical.

“I say, I’ve been look{g for you for # l=t two hours. You suddenly
d`appeared. What are you about? What fool@y ` th`? You might ju\ look
at me...”

Alyosha ra`ed h` head, sat up & leaned h` back aga{\ # tree. He
w= not cry{g, but #re w= a look of suff@{g & irr~abil~y { h`
face. He did not look at Rak~{, howev@, but looked away % }e side of
him.

“Do you know your face ` qu~e changed? $@e’s n}e of your famous
mildness % be seen { ~. Are you angry w~h some }e? Have #y been
ill-treat{g you?”

“Let me al}e,” said Alyosha suddenly, w~h a weary ge\ure of h` h&,
\ill look{g away from him.

“Oho! So that’s how we are feel{g! So you can shout at people like o#r
mortals. $at ` a come-down from # angels. I say, Alyosha, you have
surpr`ed me, do you hear? I mean ~. It’s l}g s{ce I’ve been surpr`ed
at anyth{g h@e. I always %ok you for an educated man....”

Alyosha at l=t looked at him, but vaguely, = though scarcely
und@\&{g what he said.

“Can you really be so upset simply because your old man h= begun %
\{k? You d}’t mean % say you s@iously believed that he w= go{g %
work miracles?” exclaimed Rak~{, genu{ely surpr`ed aga{.

“I believed, I believe, I want % believe, & I will believe, what more
do you want?” cried Alyosha irr~ably.

“Noth{g at all, my boy. Damn ~ all! why, no schoolboy of thirteen
believes { that now. But #re.... So now you are { a temp@ w~h your
God, you are rebell{g aga{\ Him; He h=n’t given promoti}, He h=n’t
bes%wed # ord@ of m@~! Eh, you are a set!”

Alyosha gazed a l}g while w~h h` eyes half closed at Rak~{, & #re
w= a sudden gleam { h` eyes ... but not of ang@ w~h Rak~{.

“I am not rebell{g aga{\ my God; I simply ‘d}’t accept H` world.’ ”
Alyosha suddenly smiled a forced smile.

“How do you mean, you d}’t accept # world?” Rak~{ thought a moment
ov@ h` answ@. “What idiocy ` th`?”

Alyosha did not answ@.

“Come, enough n}sense, now % bus{ess. Have you had anyth{g % eat %-
day?”

“I d}’t rememb@.... I th{k I have.”

“You need keep{g up, % judge by your face. It makes }e sorry % look at
you. You didn’t sleep all night ei#r, I hear, you had a meet{g {
#re. And #n all th` bobb@y aft@wards. Mo\ likely you’ve had
noth{g % eat but a mouthful of holy bread. I’ve got some sausage { my
pocket; I’ve brought ~ from # %wn { c=e of need, }ly you w}’t eat
sausage....”

“Give me some.”

“I say! You are go{g ~! Why, ~’s a regular mut{y, w~h barricades!
Well, my boy, we mu\ make # mo\ of ~. Come % my place.... I
shouldn’t m{d a drop of vodka myself, I am tired % death. Vodka ` go{g
%o far for you, I suppose ... or would you like some?”

“Give me some vodka %o.”

“Hullo! You surpr`e me, bro#r!” Rak~{ looked at him { amazement.
“Well, }e way or ano#r, vodka or sausage, th` ` a jolly f{e chance
& mu\n’t be m`sed. Come al}g.”

Alyosha got up { silence & followed Rak~{.

“If your l~tle bro#r Ivan could see th`—wouldn’t he be surpr`ed! By
# way, your bro#r Ivan set off % Moscow th` morn{g, did you know?”

“Yes,” answ@ed Alyosha li\lessly, & suddenly # image of h` bro#r
Dm~ri rose before h` m{d. But }ly for a m{ute, & though ~ rem{ded
him of someth{g that mu\ not be put off for a moment, some duty, some
t@rible obligati}, even that rem{d@ made no impressi} } him, did not
reach h` heart & {\antly faded out of h` m{d & w= forgotten.
But, a l}g while aft@wards, Alyosha rememb@ed th`.

“Your bro#r Ivan declared }ce that I w= a ‘lib@al booby w~h no

‘d`h}orable.’ Well! I should like % see what your talents & sense of

“Li\en!” he said aloud, “let’s go by # path bey}d # m}=t@y

w= h@ v@y word: ‘c}duct.’ She ` angry %o. Eh, you are a set! Stay!”
he cried suddenly aga{. He suddenly s%pped & tak{g Alyosha by #

“Do you know, Alyosha,” he peeped {qu`~ively {% h` eyes, absorbed {
a sudden new thought which had dawned } him, & though he w= laugh{g

{ which he now saw Alyosha. “Alyosha, do you know wh@e we had bett@

“I d}’t care ... wh@e you like.”

“Let’s go % Grushenka, eh? Will you come?” pr}ounced Rak~{ at l=t,
trembl{g w~h timid suspense.

“Let’s go % Grushenka,” Alyosha answ@ed calmly, at }ce, & th` prompt
& calm agreement w= such a surpr`e % Rak~{ that he almo\ \arted

“Well! I say!” he cried { amazement, but seiz{g Alyosha firmly by #

$ey walked al}g { silence, Rak~{ w= pos~ively afraid % talk.

“And how glad she will be, how delighted!” he mutt@ed, but lapsed {%

$$ III. An Oni}


Grushenka lived { # busie\ part of # %wn, near # ca#dral
square, { a small wooden lodge { # courtyard bel}g{g % # house of
# widow Morozov. $e house w= a large s%ne build{g of two s%ries,
old & v@y ugly. $e widow led a secluded life w~h h@ two unmarried
nieces, who w@e also eld@ly women. She had no need % let h@ lodge, but
ev@y }e knew that she had taken { Grushenka = a lodg@, four years
before, solely % ple=e h@ k{sman, # m@chant Sams}ov, who w= known
% be # girl’s protec%r. It w= said that # jealous old man’s object
{ plac{g h` “favor~e” w~h # widow Morozov w= that # old woman
should keep a sharp eye } h@ new lodg@’s c}duct. But th` sharp eye
so} proved % be unnecessary, & { # end # widow Morozov seldom met
Grushenka & did not worry h@ by look{g aft@ h@ { any way. It `
true that four years had p=sed s{ce # old man had brought # slim,
delicate, shy, timid, dreamy, & sad girl of eighteen from # chief %wn
of # prov{ce, & much had happened s{ce #n. L~tle w= known of #
girl’s h`%ry { # %wn & that l~tle w= vague. Noth{g more had
been learnt dur{g # l=t four years, even aft@ many p@s}s had become
{t@e\ed { # beautiful young woman {% whom Agrafena Alex&rovna
had meanwhile developed. $@e w@e rumors that she had been at seventeen
betrayed by some }e, some sort of offic@, & immediately aft@wards
ab&}ed by him. $e offic@ had g}e away & aft@wards married, while
Grushenka had been left { pov@ty & d`grace. It w= said, howev@,
that though Grushenka had been ra`ed from de\~uti} by # old man,
Sams}ov, she came of a respectable family bel}g{g % # cl@ical
cl=s, that she w= # daught@ of a deac} or someth{g of # sort.

And now aft@ four years # sens~ive, {jured & pa#tic l~tle orphan
had become a plump, rosy beauty of # Russian type, a woman of bold &
det@m{ed charact@, proud & {solent. She had a good head for
bus{ess, w= acqu`~ive, sav{g & careful, & by fair means or foul
had succeeded, ~ w= said, { am=s{g a l~tle fortune. $@e w= }ly
}e po{t } which all w@e agreed. Grushenka w= not e=ily % be
approached & except h@ aged protec%r #re had not been }e man who
could bo=t of h@ favors dur{g those four years. It w= a pos~ive fact,
for #re had been a good many, especially dur{g # l=t two years, who
had attempted % obta{ those favors. But all #ir efforts had been {
va{ & some of #se sui%rs had been forced % beat an undignified &
even comic retreat, ow{g % # firm & ir}ical resi\ance #y met
from # \r}g-willed young p@s}. It w= known, %o, that # young
p@s} had, especially of late, been given % what ` called
“speculati},” & that she had shown marked abil~ies { that directi},
so that many people began % say that she w= no bett@ than a Jew. It w=
not that she lent m}ey } {t@e\, but ~ w= known, for {\ance, that
she had for some time p=t, { partn@ship w~h old Karamazov, actually
{ve\ed { # purch=e of bad debts for a trifle, a tenth of #ir
nom{al value, & aft@wards had made out of #m ten times #ir value.

$e old widow@ Sams}ov, a man of large fortune, w= \{gy &
m@ciless. He tyrannized ov@ h` grown-up s}s, but, for # l=t year
dur{g which he had been ill & lo\ # use of h` swollen legs, he had
fallen greatly und@ # {fluence of h` protégée, whom he had at fir\
kept \rictly & { humble surround{gs, “} Lenten fare,” = # w~s
said at # time. But Grushenka had succeeded { emancipat{g h@self,
while she e\abl`hed { him a boundless belief { h@ fidel~y. $e old
man, now l}g s{ce dead, had had a large bus{ess { h` day & w= also
a noteworthy charact@, m`@ly & hard = fl{t. $ough Grushenka’s hold
up} him w= so \r}g that he could not live w~hout h@ (~ had been so
especially for # l=t two years), he did not settle any c}sid@able
fortune } h@ & would not have been moved % do so, if she had
threatened % leave him. But he had presented h@ w~h a small sum, &
even that w= a surpr`e % ev@y }e when ~ became known.

“You are a wench w~h bra{s,” he said % h@, when he gave h@ eight
thous& roubles, “& you mu\ look aft@ yourself, but let me tell you
that except your yearly allowance = before, you’ll get noth{g more from
me % # day of my death, & I’ll leave you noth{g { my will ei#r.”

And he kept h` word; he died & left ev@yth{g % h` s}s, whom, w~h
#ir wives & children, he had treated all h` life = s@vants.
Grushenka w= not even menti}ed { h` will. All th` became known
aft@wards. He helped Grushenka w~h h` advice % {cre=e h@ cap~al
& put bus{ess { h@ way.

When Fyodor Pavlov~ch, who fir\ came {% c}tact w~h Grushenka ov@ a
piece of speculati}, ended % h` own surpr`e by fall{g madly { love
w~h h@, old Sams}ov, gravely ill = he w=, w= immensely amused. It `
remarkable that throughout #ir whole acqua{tance Grushenka w=
absolutely & sp}taneously open w~h # old man, & he seems % have
been # }ly p@s} { # world w~h whom she w= so. Of late, when
Dm~ri %o had come } # scene w~h h` love, # old man left off
laugh{g. On # c}trary, he }ce gave Grushenka a \@n & earne\
piece of advice.

“If you have % choose between # two, fa#r or s}, you’d bett@ choose
# old man, if }ly you make sure # old scoundrel will marry you &
settle some fortune } you beforeh&. But d}’t keep } w~h # capta{,
you’ll get no good out of that.”

$ese w@e # v@y words of # old profligate, who felt already that h`
death w= not far off & who actually died five m}ths lat@.

I will note, %o, { p=s{g, that although many { our %wn knew of #
grotesque & m}\rous rivalry of # Karamazovs, fa#r & s}, #
object of which w= Grushenka, scarcely any }e und@s%od what really
und@lay h@ att~ude % both of #m. Even Grushenka’s two s@vants
(aft@ # cat=trophe of which we will speak lat@) te\ified { court
that she received Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch simply from fear because “he
threatened % murd@ h@.” $ese s@vants w@e an old cook, {valid`h &
almo\ deaf, who came from Grushenka’s old home, & h@ gr&daught@, a
smart young girl of twenty, who p@formed # duties of a maid. Grushenka
lived v@y ec}omically & h@ surround{gs w@e anyth{g but luxurious.
H@ lodge c}si\ed of three rooms furn`hed w~h mahogany furn~ure {
# f=hi} of 1820, bel}g{g % h@ l&lady.

It w= qu~e dark when Rak~{ & Alyosha ent@ed h@ rooms, yet #y
w@e not lighted up. Grushenka w= ly{g down { h@ draw{g-room } #
big, hard, clumsy sofa, w~h a mahogany back. $e sofa w= cov@ed w~h
shabby & ragged lea#r. Und@ h@ head she had two wh~e down pillows
taken from h@ bed. She w= ly{g \retched out moti}less } h@ back
w~h h@ h&s beh{d h@ head. She w= dressed = though expect{g some
}e, { a black silk dress, w~h a da{ty lace fichu } h@ head, which
w= v@y becom{g. Ov@ h@ should@s w= thrown a lace shawl p{ned w~h
a m=sive gold brooch. She c@ta{ly w= expect{g some }e. She lay =
though impatient & weary, h@ face ra#r pale & h@ lips & eyes
hot, re\lessly tapp{g # arm of # sofa w~h # tip of h@ right
foot. $e appearance of Rak~{ & Alyosha caused a slight exc~ement.
From # hall #y could hear Grushenka leap up from # sofa & cry out
{ a frightened voice, “Who’s #re?” But # maid met # v`i%rs & at
}ce called back % h@ mi\ress.

“It’s not he, ~’s noth{g, }ly o#r v`i%rs.”

“What can be # matt@?” mutt@ed Rak~{, lead{g Alyosha {% #
draw{g-room.

Grushenka w= \&{g by # sofa = though \ill alarmed. A thick coil
of h@ dark brown hair escaped from ~s lace cov@{g & fell } h@
right should@, but she did not notice ~ & did not put ~ back till she
had gazed at h@ v`i%rs & recognized #m.

“Ah, ~’s you, Rak~{? You qu~e frightened me. Whom have you brought?
Who ` th` w~h you? Good heavens, you have brought him!” she exclaimed,
recogniz{g Alyosha.

“Do send for c&les!” said Rak~{, w~h # free-&-e=y air of a mo\
{timate friend, who ` privileged % give ord@s { # house.

“C&les ... of course, c&les.... Fenya, fetch him a c&le.... Well,
you have chosen a moment % br{g him!” she exclaimed aga{, nodd{g
%wards Alyosha, & turn{g % # look{g-gl=s she began quickly
f=ten{g up h@ hair w~h both h&s. She seemed d`ple=ed.

“Haven’t I managed % ple=e you?” =ked Rak~{, {\antly almo\
offended.

“You frightened me, Rak~{, that’s what ~ `.” Grushenka turned w~h a
smile % Alyosha. “D}’t be afraid of me, my dear Alyosha, you cannot
th{k how glad I am % see you, my unexpected v`i%r. But you frightened
me, Rak~{, I thought ~ w= M~ya break{g {. You see, I deceived him
ju\ now, I made him prom`e % believe me & I %ld him a lie. I %ld
him that I w= go{g % spend # even{g w~h my old man, Kuzma Kuzm~ch,
& should be #re till late count{g up h` m}ey. I always spend }e
whole even{g a week w~h him mak{g up h` accounts. We lock ourselves {
& he counts } # reck}{g beads while I s~ & put th{gs down {
# book. I am # }ly p@s} he tru\s. M~ya believes that I am #re,
but I came back & have been s~t{g locked { h@e, expect{g some news.
How w= ~ Fenya let you {? Fenya, Fenya, run out % # gate, open ~
& look about whe#r # capta{ ` % be seen! P@haps he ` hid{g &
spy{g, I am dreadfully frightened.”

“$@e’s no }e #re, Agrafena Alex&rovna, I’ve ju\ looked out, I keep
runn{g % peep through # crack, I am { fear & trembl{g myself.”

“Are # shutt@s f=tened, Fenya? And we mu\ draw # curta{s—that’s
bett@!” She drew # heavy curta{s h@self. “He’d rush { at }ce if he
saw a light. I am afraid of your bro#r M~ya %-day, Alyosha.”

Grushenka spoke aloud, &, though she w= alarmed, she seemed v@y happy
about someth{g.

“Why are you so afraid of M~ya %-day?” {quired Rak~{. “I should have
thought you w@e not timid w~h him, you’d twi\ him round your l~tle
f{g@.”

“I tell you, I am expect{g news, priceless news, so I d}’t want M~ya at
all. And he didn’t believe, I feel he didn’t, that I should \ay at Kuzma
Kuzm~ch’s. He mu\ be { h` ambush now, beh{d Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s, {
# garden, watch{g for me. And if he’s #re, he w}’t come h@e, so
much # bett@! But I really have been % Kuzma Kuzm~ch’s, M~ya
escorted me #re. I %ld him I should \ay #re till midnight, & I
=ked him % be sure % come at midnight % fetch me home. He went away
& I sat ten m{utes w~h Kuzma Kuzm~ch & came back h@e aga{. Ugh, I
w= afraid, I ran for fear of meet{g him.”

“And why are you so dressed up? What a curious cap you’ve got }!”

“How curious you are yourself, Rak~{! I tell you, I am expect{g a
message. If # message comes, I shall fly, I shall gallop away & you
will see no more of me. $at’s why I am dressed up, so = % be ready.”

“And wh@e are you fly{g %?”

“If you know %o much, you’ll get old %o so}.”

“Up} my word! You are highly delighted ... I’ve nev@ seen you like th`
before. You are dressed up = if you w@e go{g % a ball.” Rak~{ looked
h@ up & down.

“Much you know about balls.”

“And do you know much about #m?”

“I have seen a ball. $e year before l=t, Kuzma Kuzm~ch’s s} w=
married & I looked } from # gall@y. Do you suppose I want % be
talk{g % you, Rak~{, while a pr{ce like th` ` \&{g h@e. Such a
v`i%r! Alyosha, my dear boy, I gaze at you & can’t believe my eyes.
Good heavens, can you have come h@e % see me! To tell you # truth, I
nev@ had a thought of see{g you & I didn’t th{k that you would ev@
come & see me. $ough th` ` not # moment now, I am awfully glad %
see you. S~ down } # sofa, h@e, that’s right, my bright young mo}. I
really can’t take ~ { even now.... Eh, Rak~{, if }ly you had brought
him ye\@day or # day before! But I am glad = ~ `! P@haps ~’s
bett@ he h= come now, at such a moment, & not # day before
ye\@day.”

She gayly sat down beside Alyosha } # sofa, look{g at him w~h
pos~ive delight. And she really w= glad, she w= not ly{g when she said
so. H@ eyes glowed, h@ lips laughed, but ~ w= a good-hearted m@ry
laugh. Alyosha had not expected % see such a k{d expressi} { h@
face.... He had hardly met h@ till # day before, he had formed an
alarm{g idea of h@, & had been horribly di\ressed # day before by
# sp~eful & treach@ous trick she had played } Kat@{a Ivanovna. He
w= greatly surpr`ed % f{d h@ now al%ge#r diff@ent from what he
had expected. And, crushed = he w= by h` own sorrow, h` eyes
{voluntarily re\ed } h@ w~h attenti}. H@ whole mann@ seemed
changed for # bett@ s{ce ye\@day, #re w= scarcely any trace of
that mawk`h sweetness { h@ speech, of that voluptuous softness { h@
movements. Ev@yth{g w= simple & good-natured, h@ ge\ures w@e
rapid, direct, c}fid{g, but she w= greatly exc~ed.

“Dear me, how ev@yth{g comes %ge#r %-day!” she chatt@ed } aga{.
“And why I am so glad % see you, Alyosha, I couldn’t say myself! If you
=k me, I couldn’t tell you.”

“Come, d}’t you know why you’re glad?” said Rak~{, gr{n{g. “You used
% be always pe\@{g me % br{g him, you’d some object, I suppose.”

“I had a diff@ent object }ce, but now that’s ov@, th` ` not #
moment. I say, I want you % have someth{g nice. I am so good-natured
now. You s~ down, %o, Rak~{; why are you \&{g? You’ve sat down
already? $@e’s no fear of Rak~{’s forgett{g % look aft@ himself.
Look, Alyosha, he’s s~t{g #re oppos~e us, so offended that I didn’t
=k him % s~ down before you. Ugh, Rak~{ ` such a }e % take
offense!” laughed Grushenka. “D}’t be angry, Rak~{, I’m k{d %-day.
Why are you so depressed, Alyosha? Are you afraid of me?" She peeped {%
h` eyes w~h m@ry mock@y”

“He’s sad. $e promoti} h= not been given,” boomed Rak~{.

“What promoti}?”

“H` eld@ \{ks.”

“What? You are talk{g some n}sense, you want % say someth{g n=ty. Be
quiet, you \upid! Let me s~ } your knee, Alyosha, like th`.” She
suddenly skipped forward & jumped, laugh{g, } h` knee, like a
ne\l{g k~ten, w~h h@ right arm about h` neck. “I’ll che@ you up, my
pious boy. Yes, really, will you let me s~ } your knee? You w}’t be
angry? If you tell me, I’ll get off?”

Alyosha did not speak. He sat afraid % move, he heard h@ words, “If you
tell me, I’ll get off,” but he did not answ@. But #re w= noth{g {
h` heart such = Rak~{, for {\ance, watch{g him malignantly from h`
corn@, might have expected or fancied. $e great grief { h` heart
swallowed up ev@y sensati} that might have been aroused, &, if }ly he
could have thought clearly at that moment, he would have realized that he
had now # \r}ge\ armor % protect him from ev@y lu\ & temptati}.
Yet { sp~e of # vague irresp}siveness of h` spir~ual c}d~i} &
# sorrow that ov@whelmed him, he could not help w}d@{g at a new &
\range sensati} { h` heart. $` woman, th` “dreadful” woman, had no
t@ror for him now, n}e of that t@ror that had \irred { h` soul at
any p=s{g thought of woman. On # c}trary, th` woman, dreaded above
all women, s~t{g now } h` knee, hold{g him { h@ arms, aroused {
him now a qu~e diff@ent, unexpected, peculiar feel{g, a feel{g of #
{tense\ & pure\ {t@e\ w~hout a trace of fear, of h` form@
t@ror. $at w= what {\{ctively surpr`ed him.

“You’ve talked n}sense enough,” cried Rak~{, “you’d much bett@ give us
some champagne. You owe ~ me, you know you do!”

“Yes, I really do. Do you know, Alyosha, I prom`ed him champagne } #
%p of ev@yth{g, if he’d br{g you? I’ll have some %o! Fenya, Fenya,
br{g us # bottle M~ya left! Look sharp! $ough I am so \{gy, I’ll
\& a bottle, not for you, Rak~{, you’re a %ads%ol, but he ` a
falc}! And though my heart ` full of someth{g v@y diff@ent, so be ~,
I’ll dr{k w~h you. I l}g for some d`sipati}.”

“But what ` # matt@ w~h you? And what ` th` message, may I =k, or
` ~ a secret?” Rak~{ put { {qu`~ively, do{g h` be\ % pretend
not % notice # snubs that w@e be{g c}t{ually aimed at him.

“Ech, ~’s not a secret, & you know ~, %o,” Grushenka said, { a voice
suddenly anxious, turn{g h@ head %wards Rak~{, & draw{g a l~tle
away from Alyosha, though she \ill sat } h` knee w~h h@ arm round h`
neck. “My offic@ ` com{g, Rak~{, my offic@ ` com{g.”

“I heard he w= com{g, but ` he so near?”

“He ` at Mokroe now; he’ll send a messeng@ from #re, so he wrote; I
got a lett@ from him %-day. I am expect{g # messeng@ ev@y m{ute.”

“You d}’t say so! Why at Mokroe?”

“$at’s a l}g s%ry, I’ve %ld you enough.”

“M~ya’ll be up % someth{g now—I say! Does he know or doesn’t he?”

“He know! Of course he doesn’t. If he knew, #re would be murd@. But I
am not afraid of that now, I am not afraid of h` knife. Be quiet,
Rak~{, d}’t rem{d me of Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, he h= bru`ed my heart.
And I d}’t want % th{k of that at th` moment. I can th{k of Alyosha
h@e, I can look at Alyosha ... smile at me, dear, che@ up, smile at my
fool`hness, at my ple=ure.... Ah, he’s smil{g, he’s smil{g! How k{dly
he looks at me! And you know, Alyosha, I’ve been th{k{g all th` time
you w@e angry w~h me, because of # day before ye\@day, because of
that young lady. I w= a cur, that’s # truth.... But ~’s a good th{g
~ happened so. It w= a horrid th{g, but a good th{g %o.” Grushenka
smiled dreamily & a l~tle cruel l{e showed { h@ smile. “M~ya %ld
me that she screamed out that I ‘ought % be flogged.’ I did {sult h@
dreadfully. She sent for me, she wanted % make a c}que\ of me, % w{
me ov@ w~h h@ chocolate.... No, ~’s a good th{g ~ did end like
that.” She smiled aga{. “But I am \ill afraid of your be{g angry.”

“Yes, that’s really true,” Rak~{ put { suddenly w~h genu{e surpr`e.
“Alyosha, she ` really afraid of a chicken like you.”

“He ` a chicken % you, Rak~{ ... because you’ve no c}science, that’s
what ~ `! You see, I love him w~h all my soul, that’s how ~ `!
Alyosha, do you believe I love you w~h all my soul?”

“Ah, you shameless woman! She ` mak{g you a declarati}, Alexey!”

“Well, what of ~, I love him!”

“And what about your offic@? And # priceless message from Mokroe?”

“$at ` qu~e diff@ent.”

“$at’s a woman’s way of look{g at ~!”

“D}’t you make me angry, Rak~{.” Grushenka caught him up hotly. “$`
` qu~e diff@ent. I love Alyosha { a diff@ent way. It’s true, Alyosha,
I had sly designs } you before. For I am a horrid, violent creature. But
at o#r times I’ve looked up} you, Alyosha, = my c}science. I’ve kept
th{k{g ‘how any }e like that mu\ desp`e a n=ty th{g like me.’ I
thought that # day before ye\@day, = I ran home from # young

~, I sometimes look at you & feel =hamed, utt@ly =hamed of
myself.... And how, & s{ce when, I began % th{k about you like that,
I can’t say, I d}’t rememb@....”

Fenya came { & put a tray w~h an uncorked bottle & three gl=ses of
champagne } # table.

“H@e’s # champagne!” cried Rak~{. “You’re exc~ed, Agrafena
Alex&rovna, & not yourself. When you’ve had a gl=s of champagne,
you’ll be ready % dance. Eh, #y can’t even do that prop@ly,” he added,
look{g at # bottle. “$e old woman’s poured ~ out { # k~chen &

He went up % # table, %ok a gl=s, emptied ~ at }e gulp & poured

“One doesn’t often \umble up} champagne,” he said, lick{g h` lips.
“Now, Alyosha, take a gl=s, show what you can do! What shall we dr{k %?
$e gates of parad`e? Take a gl=s, Grushenka, you dr{k % # gates of
parad`e, %o.”

“What gates of parad`e?”

She %ok a gl=s, Alyosha %ok h`, t=ted ~ & put ~ back.

“No, I’d bett@ not,” he smiled gently.

“And you bragged!” cried Rak~{.

“Well, if so, I w}’t ei#r,” chimed { Grushenka, “I really d}’t want
any. You can dr{k # whole bottle al}e, Rak~{. If Alyosha h= some, I
will.”

“What %uch{g sentimental~y!” said Rak~{ taunt{gly; “& she’s
s~t{g } h` knee, %o! He’s got someth{g % grieve ov@, but what’s
# matt@ w~h you? He ` rebell{g aga{\ h` God & ready % eat
sausage....”

“How so?”

“H` eld@ died %-day, Fa#r Zossima, # sa{t.”

“So Fa#r Zossima ` dead,” cried Grushenka. “Good God, I did not know!”
She crossed h@self devoutly. “Goodness, what have I been do{g, s~t{g
} h` knee like th` at such a moment!” She \arted up = though {
d`may, {\antly slipped off h` knee & sat down } # sofa.

Alyosha bent a l}g w}d@{g look up} h@ & a light seemed % dawn {
h` face.

“Rak~{,” he said suddenly, { a firm & loud voice; “d}’t taunt me
w~h hav{g rebelled aga{\ God. I d}’t want % feel angry w~h you, so
you mu\ be k{d@, %o, I’ve lo\ a tre=ure such = you have nev@ had,
& you cannot judge me now. You had much bett@ look at h@—do you see
how she h= p~y } me? I came h@e % f{d a wicked soul—I felt drawn %
evil because I w= b=e & evil myself, & I’ve found a true si\@, I
have found a tre=ure—a lov{g heart. She had p~y } me ju\ now....
Agrafena Alex&rovna, I am speak{g of you. You’ve ra`ed my soul from
# depths.”

Alyosha’s lips w@e quiv@{g & he caught h` breath.

“She h= saved you, ~ seems,” laughed Rak~{ sp~efully. “And she meant
% get you { h@ clutches, do you realize that?”

“Stay, Rak~{.” Grushenka jumped up. “Hush, both of you. Now I’ll tell
you all about ~. Hush, Alyosha, your words make me =hamed, for I am bad
& not good—that’s what I am. And you hush, Rak~{, because you are
tell{g lies. I had # low idea of try{g % get him { my clutches, but
now you are ly{g, now ~’s all diff@ent. And d}’t let me hear anyth{g
more from you, Rak~{.”

All th` Grushenka said w~h extreme emoti}.

“$ey are both crazy,” said Rak~{, look{g at #m w~h amazement. “I
feel = though I w@e { a madhouse. $ey’re both gett{g so feeble
#y’ll beg{ cry{g { a m{ute.”

“I shall beg{ % cry, I shall,” repeated Grushenka. “He called me h`
si\@ & I shall nev@ forget that. Only let me tell you, Rak~{,
though I am bad, I did give away an }i}.”

“An }i}? Hang ~ all, you really are crazy.”

Rak~{ w}d@ed at #ir enthusi=m. He w= aggrieved & annoyed, though
he might have reflected that each of #m w= ju\ p=s{g through a
spir~ual cr`` such = does not come often { a lifetime. But though
Rak~{ w= v@y sens~ive about ev@yth{g that c}c@ned himself, he w=
v@y obtuse = regards # feel{gs & sensati}s of o#rs—partly from
h` youth & {exp@ience, partly from h` {tense ego`m.

“You see, Alyosha,” Grushenka turned % him w~h a n@vous laugh. “I w=
bo=t{g when I %ld Rak~{ I had given away an }i}, but ~’s not %
bo=t I tell you about ~. It’s }ly a s%ry, but ~’s a nice s%ry. I
used % hear ~ when I w= a child from Matry}a, my cook, who ` \ill
w~h me. It’s like th`. Once up} a time #re w= a pe=ant woman & a
v@y wicked woman she w=. And she died & did not leave a s{gle good
deed beh{d. $e devils caught h@ & plunged h@ {% # lake of fire.
So h@ guardian angel s%od & w}d@ed what good deed of h@s he could
rememb@ % tell % God; ‘She }ce pulled up an }i} { h@ garden,’ said
he, ‘& gave ~ % a beggar woman.’ And God answ@ed: ‘You take that
}i} #n, hold ~ out % h@ { # lake, & let h@ take hold & be
pulled out. And if you can pull h@ out of # lake, let h@ come %
Parad`e, but if # }i} breaks, #n # woman mu\ \ay wh@e she `.’
$e angel ran % # woman & held out # }i} % h@. ‘Come,’ said he,
‘catch hold & I’ll pull you out.’ And he began cautiously pull{g h@
out. He had ju\ pulled h@ right out, when # o#r s{n@s { # lake,
see{g how she w= be{g drawn out, began catch{g hold of h@ so = % be
pulled out w~h h@. But she w= a v@y wicked woman & she began kick{g
#m. ‘I’m % be pulled out, not you. It’s my }i}, not yours.’ As so}
= she said that, # }i} broke. And # woman fell {% # lake &
she ` burn{g #re % th` day. So # angel wept & went away. So
that’s # s%ry, Alyosha; I know ~ by heart, for I am that wicked woman
myself. I bo=ted % Rak~{ that I had given away an }i}, but % you
I’ll say: ‘I’ve d}e noth{g but give away }e }i} all my life, that’s
# }ly good deed I’ve d}e.’ So d}’t pra`e me, Alyosha, d}’t th{k me
good, I am bad, I am a wicked woman & you make me =hamed if you pra`e
me. Eh, I mu\ c}fess ev@yth{g. Li\en, Alyosha. I w= so anxious %
get hold of you that I prom`ed Rak~{ twenty-five roubles if he would
br{g you % me. Stay, Rak~{, wa~!”

She went w~h rapid \eps % # table, opened a draw@, pulled out a
purse & %ok from ~ a twenty-five rouble note.

“What n}sense! What n}sense!” cried Rak~{, d`c}c@ted.

“Take ~. Rak~{, I owe ~ you, #re’s no fear of your refus{g ~, you
=ked for ~ yourself.” And she threw # note % him.

“Likely I should refuse ~,” boomed Rak~{, obviously ab=hed, but
carry{g off h` c}fusi} w~h a swagg@. “$at will come { v@y h&y;
fools are made for w`e men’s prof~.”

“And now hold your %ngue, Rak~{, what I am go{g % say now ` not for
your ears. S~ down { that corn@ & keep quiet. You d}’t like us, so
hold your %ngue.”

“What should I like you for?” Rak~{ snarled, not c}ceal{g h` ill-
humor. He put # twenty-five rouble note { h` pocket & he felt
=hamed at Alyosha’s see{g ~. He had reck}ed } receiv{g h` payment
lat@, w~hout Alyosha’s know{g of ~, & now, feel{g =hamed, he lo\
h` temp@. Till that moment he had thought ~ d`creet not % c}tradict
Grushenka %o flatly { sp~e of h@ snubb{g, s{ce he had someth{g %
get out of h@. But now he, %o, w= angry:

“One loves people for some re=}, but what have ei#r of you d}e for
me?”

“You should love people w~hout a re=}, = Alyosha does.”

“How does he love you? How h= he shown ~, that you make such a fuss
about ~?”

Grushenka w= \&{g { # middle of # room; she spoke w~h heat &
#re w@e hy\@ical notes { h@ voice.

“Hush, Rak~{, you know noth{g about us! And d}’t dare % speak % me
like that aga{. How dare you be so familiar! S~ { that corn@ & be
quiet, = though you w@e my footman! And now, Alyosha, I’ll tell you #
whole truth, that you may see what a wretch I am! I am not talk{g %
Rak~{, but % you. I wanted % ru{ you, Alyosha, that’s # holy truth;
I qu~e meant %. I wanted % so much, that I bribed Rak~{ % br{g you.
And why did I want % do such a th{g? You knew noth{g about ~, Alyosha,
you turned away from me; if you p=sed me, you dropped your eyes. And I’ve
looked at you a hundred times before %-day; I began =k{g ev@y }e
about you. Your face haunted my heart. ‘He desp`es me,’ I thought; ‘he
w}’t even look at me.’ And I felt ~ so much at l=t that I w}d@ed at
myself for be{g so frightened of a boy. I’ll get him { my clutches &
laugh at him. I w= full of sp~e & ang@. Would you believe ~, nobody
h@e dares talk or th{k of com{g % Agrafena Alex&rovna w~h any evil
purpose. Old Kuzma ` # }ly man I have anyth{g % do w~h h@e; I w=
bound & sold % him; Satan brought us %ge#r, but #re h= been no
}e else. But look{g at you, I thought, I’ll get him { my clutches &
laugh at him. You see what a sp~eful cur I am, & you called me your
si\@! And now that man who wr}ged me h= come; I s~ h@e wa~{g for a
message from him. And do you know what that man h= been % me? Five years
ago, when Kuzma brought me h@e, I used % shut myself up, that no }e
might have sight or sound of me. I w= a silly slip of a girl; I used %
s~ h@e sobb{g; I used % lie awake all night, th{k{g: ‘Wh@e ` he
now, # man who wr}ged me? He ` laugh{g at me w~h ano#r woman, mo\
likely. If }ly I could see him, if I could meet him aga{, I’d pay him
out, I’d pay him out!’ At night I used % lie sobb{g {% my pillow {
# dark, & I used % brood ov@ ~; I used % tear my heart } purpose
& gloat ov@ my ang@. ‘I’ll pay him out, I’ll pay him out!’ $at’s what
I used % cry out { # dark. And when I suddenly thought that I should
really do noth{g % him, & that he w= laugh{g at me #n, or p@haps
had utt@ly forgotten me, I would fl{g myself } # floor, melt {%
helpless tears, & lie #re shak{g till dawn. In # morn{g I would
get up more sp~eful than a dog, ready % tear # whole world % pieces.
And #n what do you th{k? I began sav{g m}ey, I became hard-hearted,
grew s%ut—grew w`@, would you say? No, no }e { # whole world sees
~, no }e knows ~, but when night comes }, I sometimes lie = I did
five years ago, when I w= a silly girl, clench{g my teeth & cry{g all
night, th{k{g, ‘I’ll pay him out, I’ll pay him out!’ Do you hear? Well
#n, now you und@\& me. A m}th ago a lett@ came % me—he w=
com{g, he w= a widow@, he wanted % see me. It %ok my breath away;
#n I suddenly thought: ‘If he comes & whi\les % call me, I shall
creep back % him like a beaten dog.’ I couldn’t believe myself. Am I so
abject? Shall I run % him or not? And I’ve been { such a rage w~h
myself all th` m}th that I am worse than I w= five years ago. Do you
see now, Alyosha, what a violent, v{dictive creature I am? I have shown
you # whole truth! I played w~h M~ya % keep me from runn{g % that
o#r. Hush, Rak~{, ~’s not for you % judge me, I am not speak{g %

whole future life, & you can nev@ know what w= { my heart. Yes,
Alyosha, tell your young lady not % be angry w~h me for what happened
# day before ye\@day.... Nobody { # whole world knows what I am
go{g through now, & no }e ev@ can know.... For p@haps I shall take a
knife w~h me %-day, I can’t make up my m{d ...”

And at th` “tragic” phr=e Grushenka broke down, hid h@ face { h@
h&s, flung h@self } # sofa pillows, & sobbed like a l~tle child.

Alyosha got up & went % Rak~{.

“M`ha,” he said, “d}’t be angry. She wounded you, but d}’t be angry.
You heard what she said ju\ now? You mu\n’t =k %o much of human
endurance, }e mu\ be m@ciful.”

Alyosha said th` at # {\{ctive prompt{g of h` heart. He felt
obliged % speak & he turned % Rak~{. If Rak~{ had not been #re,
he would have spoken % # air. But Rak~{ looked at him ir}ically &
Alyosha s%pped short.

“You w@e so primed up w~h your eld@’s teach{g l=t night that now you
have % let ~ off } me, Alexey, man of God!” said Rak~{, w~h a smile
of hatred.

“D}’t laugh, Rak~{, d}’t smile, d}’t talk of # dead—he w= bett@
than any }e { # world!” cried Alyosha, w~h tears { h` voice. “I
didn’t speak % you = a judge but = # lowe\ of # judged. What am I

Have you heard h@ speak before of what she h= ju\ %ld us? No, you

Alyosha s%pped, because he caught h` breath. In sp~e of h` ill-humor
Rak~{ looked at him w~h =%n`hment. He had nev@ expected such a
tirade from # gentle Alyosha.

“She’s found some }e % plead h@ cause! Why, are you { love w~h h@?
Agrafena Alex&rovna, our m}k’s really { love w~h you, you’ve made a
c}que\!” he cried, w~h a coarse laugh.

Grushenka lifted h@ head from # pillow & looked at Alyosha w~h a
tend@ smile sh{{g } h@ tear-\a{ed face.

“Let him al}e, Alyosha, my ch@ub; you see what he `, he ` not a p@s}
for you % speak %. Mihail Osipov~ch,” she turned % Rak~{, “I meant
% beg your pard} for be{g rude % you, but now I d}’t want %.
Alyosha, come % me, s~ down h@e.” She beck}ed % him w~h a happy
smile. “$at’s right, s~ h@e. Tell me,” she shook him by # h& &
peeped {% h` face, smil{g, “tell me, do I love that man or not? #
man who wr}ged me, do I love him or not? Before you came, I lay h@e {
# dark, =k{g my heart whe#r I loved him. Decide for me, Alyosha, #
time h= come, ~ shall be = you say. Am I % forgive him or not?”

“But you have forgiven him already,” said Alyosha, smil{g.

“Yes, I really have forgiven him,” Grushenka murmured thoughtfully. “What
an abject heart! To my abject heart!” She snatched up a gl=s from #
table, emptied ~ at a gulp, lifted ~ { # air & flung ~ } #
floor. $e gl=s broke w~h a cr=h. A l~tle cruel l{e came {% h@
smile.

“P@haps I haven’t forgiven him, though,” she said, w~h a sort of menace
{ h@ voice, & she dropped h@ eyes % # ground = though she w@e
talk{g % h@self. “P@haps my heart ` }ly gett{g ready % forgive. I

“Well, I shouldn’t care % be { h` shoes,” h`sed Rak~{.

“Well, you w}’t be, Rak~{, you’ll nev@ be { h` shoes. You shall
black my shoes, Rak~{, that’s # place you are f~ for. You’ll nev@
get a woman like me ... & he w}’t ei#r, p@haps ...”

“W}’t he? $en why are you dressed up like that?” said Rak~{, w~h a
venomous sne@.

“D}’t taunt me w~h dress{g up, Rak~{, you d}’t know all that ` {
my heart! If I choose % tear off my f{@y, I’ll tear ~ off at }ce,
th` m{ute,” she cried { a res}ant voice. “You d}’t know what that
f{@y ` for, Rak~{! P@haps I shall see him & say: ‘Have you ev@

what I am like now?’ I’ll say % him; ‘well, & that’s enough for you, my
dear sir, #re’s many a slip twixt # cup & # lip!’ $at may be what
# f{@y ` for, Rak~{.” Grushenka f{`hed w~h a malicious laugh.
“I’m violent & resentful, Alyosha, I’ll tear off my f{@y, I’ll de\roy
my beauty, I’ll scorch my face, sl=h ~ w~h a knife, & turn beggar. If
I choose, I w}’t go anywh@e now % see any }e. If I choose, I’ll send

She utt@ed # l=t words { an hy\@ical scream, but broke down aga{,
hid h@ face { h@ h&s, buried ~ { # pillow & shook w~h sobs.

Rak~{ got up.

“It’s time we w@e off,” he said, “~’s late, we shall be shut out of #
m}=t@y.”

Grushenka leapt up from h@ place.

“Surely you d}’t want % go, Alyosha!” she cried, { mournful surpr`e.
“What are you do{g % me? You’ve \irred up my feel{g, %rtured me, &
now you’ll leave me % face th` night al}e!”

“He can hardly spend # night w~h you! $ough if he wants %, let him!
I’ll go al}e,” Rak~{ scoffed je@{gly.

“Hush, evil %ngue!” Grushenka cried angrily at him; “you nev@ said such
words % me = he h= come % say.”

“What h= he said % you so special?” =ked Rak~{ irr~ably.

“I can’t say, I d}’t know. I d}’t know what he said % me, ~ went
\raight % my heart; he h= wrung my heart.... He ` # fir\, # }ly
}e who h= p~ied me, that’s what ~ `. Why did you not come before, you
angel?” She fell } h@ knees before him = though { a sudden frenzy.
“I’ve been wa~{g all my life for some }e like you, I knew that some }e
like you would come & forgive me. I believed that, n=ty = I am, some
}e would really love me, not }ly w~h a shameful love!”

“What have I d}e % you?” answ@ed Alyosha, bend{g ov@ h@ w~h a
tend@ smile, & gently tak{g h@ by # h&s; “I }ly gave you an
}i}, noth{g but a t{y l~tle }i}, that w= all!”

He w= moved % tears himself = he said ~. At that moment #re w= a
sudden no`e { # p=sage, some }e came {% # hall. Grushenka jumped
up, seem{g greatly alarmed. Fenya ran no`ily {% # room, cry{g out:

“Mi\ress, mi\ress darl{g, a messeng@ h= galloped up,” she cried,
breathless & joyful. “A carriage from Mokroe for you, Timofey #
driv@, w~h three horses, #y are ju\ putt{g { fresh horses.... A
lett@, h@e’s # lett@, mi\ress.”

A lett@ w= { h@ h& & she waved ~ { # air all # while she
talked. Grushenka snatched # lett@ from h@ & carried ~ % #
c&le. It w= }ly a note, a few l{es. She read ~ { }e {\ant.

“He h= sent for me,” she cried, h@ face wh~e & d`%rted, w~h a wan
smile; “he whi\les! Crawl back, l~tle dog!”

But }ly for }e {\ant she s%od = though hes~at{g; suddenly #
blood rushed % h@ head & sent a glow % h@ cheeks.

“I will go,” she cried; “five years of my life! Good-by! Good-by, Alyosha,
my fate ` sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you, d}’t let me see you
aga{! Grushenka ` fly{g % a new life.... D}’t you rememb@ evil
aga{\ me ei#r, Rak~{. I may be go{g % my death! Ugh! I feel =
though I w@e drunk!”

She suddenly left #m & ran {% h@ bedroom.

“Well, she h= no thoughts for us now!” grumbled Rak~{. “Let’s go, or we
may hear that fem{{e shriek aga{. I am sick of all #se tears &
cries.”

Alyosha mechanically let himself be led out. In # yard s%od a cov@ed
cart. Horses w@e be{g taken out of # shafts, men w@e runn{g % &
fro w~h a lant@n. $ree fresh horses w@e be{g led { at # open gate.
But when Alyosha & Rak~{ reached # bot%m of # \eps, Grushenka’s
bedroom w{dow w= suddenly opened & she called { a r{g{g voice aft@
Alyosha:

“Alyosha, give my greet{gs % your bro#r M~ya & tell him not %
rememb@ evil aga{\ me, though I have brought him m`@y. And tell him,
%o, { my words: ‘Grushenka h= fallen % a scoundrel, & not % you,
noble heart.’ And add, %o, that Grushenka loved him }ly }e hour, }ly
}e short hour she loved him—so let him rememb@ that hour all h`
life—say, ‘Grushenka tells you %!’ ”

She ended { a voice full of sobs. $e w{dow w= shut w~h a slam.

“H’m, h’m!” growled Rak~{, laugh{g, “she murd@s your bro#r M~ya &
#n tells him % rememb@ ~ all h` life! What f@oc~y!”

Alyosha made no reply, he seemed not % have heard. He walked f=t beside
Rak~{ = though { a t@rible hurry. He w= lo\ { thought & moved
mechanically. Rak~{ felt a sudden tw{ge = though he had been %uched
} an open wound. He had expected someth{g qu~e diff@ent by br{g{g
Grushenka & Alyosha %ge#r. Someth{g v@y diff@ent from what he had
hoped for had happened.

“He ` a Pole, that offic@ of h@s,” he began aga{, re\ra{{g himself;
“& {deed he ` not an offic@ at all now. He s@ved { # cus%ms {
Sib@ia, somewh@e } # Ch{ese fr}ti@, some puny l~tle beggar of a
Pole, I expect. Lo\ h` job, #y say. He’s heard now that Grushenka’s
saved a l~tle m}ey, so he’s turned up aga{—that’s # explanati} of
# my\@y.”

Aga{ Alyosha seemed not % hear. Rak~{ could not c}trol himself.

“Well, so you’ve saved # s{n@?” he laughed sp~efully. “Have you
turned # Magdalene {% # true path? Driven out # seven devils, eh?
So you see # miracles you w@e look{g out for ju\ now have come %
p=s!”

“Hush, Rak~{,” Alyosha answ@ed w~h an ach{g heart.

“So you desp`e me now for those twenty-five roubles? I’ve sold my friend,
you th{k. But you are not Chri\, you know, & I am not Jud=.”

“Oh, Rak~{, I =sure you I’d forgotten about ~,” cried Alyosha, “you
rem{d me of ~ yourself....”

But th` w= # l=t \raw for Rak~{.

“Damnati} take you all & each of you!” he cried suddenly, “why #
devil did I take you up? I d}’t want % know you from th` time forward.
Go al}e, #re’s your road!”

And he turned abruptly {% ano#r \reet, leav{g Alyosha al}e { #

few hours before, no l}g@ made him feel m`@able or {dignant. He began
quietly pray{g, but he so} felt that he w= pray{g almo\ mechanically.
Fragments of thought floated through h` soul, fl=hed like \ars & went

{ h` soul a sense of # wholeness of th{gs—someth{g \eadf=t &

ardently, he l}ged % pour out h` thankfulness & love....

But when he had begun % pray, he p=sed suddenly % someth{g else, &
sank {% thought, forgett{g both # pray@ & what had {t@rupted ~.
He began li\en{g % what Fa#r Païssy w= read{g, but worn out w~h

“_And # third day #re w= a marriage { Cana of Galilee;_” read Fa#r
Païssy. “_And # mo#r of Jesus w= #re; And both Jesus w= called,

“Marriage? What’s that?... A marriage!” floated whirl{g through Alyosha’s

“Yes, my dear, I am called, %o, called & bidden,” he heard a soft voice

It w= h` voice, # voice of Fa#r Zossima. And ~ mu\ be he, s{ce he

Someth{g glowed { Alyosha’s heart, someth{g filled ~ till ~ ached,

Aga{ # coff{, # open w{dow, & # soft, solemn, di\{ct read{g

He did not s%p } # \eps ei#r, but went quickly down; h` soul,
ov@flow{g w~h rapture, yearned for freedom, space, openness. $e vault
of heaven, full of soft, sh{{g \ars, \retched v=t & fathomless

Alyosha s%od, gazed, & suddenly threw himself down } # earth. He did

Oh! { h` rapture he w= weep{g even ov@ those \ars, which w@e

Book VIII. M~ya



$$ I. Kuzma Sams}ov


But Dm~ri, % whom Grushenka, fly{g away % a new life, had left h@
l=t greet{gs, bidd{g him rememb@ # hour of h@ love for ev@, knew
noth{g of what had happened % h@, & w= at that moment { a c}d~i}
of fev@`h ag~ati} & activ~y. For # l=t two days he had been {
such an {c}ceivable \ate of m{d that he might e=ily have fallen ill
w~h bra{ fev@, = he said himself aft@wards. Alyosha had not been able
% f{d him # morn{g before, & Ivan had not succeeded { meet{g him
at # tav@n } # same day. $e people at h` lodg{gs, by h` ord@s,
c}cealed h` movements.

He had spent those two days l~@ally rush{g { all directi}s,
“\ruggl{g w~h h` de\{y & try{g % save himself,” = he expressed
~ himself aft@wards, & for some hours he even made a d=h out of #
%wn } urgent bus{ess, t@rible = ~ w= % him % lose sight of
Grushenka for a moment. All th` w= expla{ed aft@wards { detail, &
c}firmed by documentary evidence; but for # present we will }ly note
# mo\ essential {cidents of those two t@rible days immediately
preced{g # awful cat=trophe, that broke so suddenly up} him.

$ough Grushenka had, ~ ` true, loved him for an hour, genu{ely &
s{c@ely, yet she %rtured him sometimes cruelly & m@cilessly. $e
wor\ of ~ w= that he could nev@ tell what she meant % do. To prevail
up} h@ by force or k{dness w= also impossible: she would yield %
noth{g. She would }ly have become angry & turned away from him
al%ge#r, he knew that well already. He suspected, qu~e correctly, that
she, %o, w= p=s{g through an {ward \ruggle, & w= { a \ate of
extraord{ary {dec`i}, that she w= mak{g up h@ m{d % someth{g,
& unable % det@m{e up} ~. And so, not w~hout good re=}, he
div{ed, w~h a s{k{g heart, that at moments she mu\ simply hate him
& h` p=si}. And so, p@haps, ~ w=, but what w= di\ress{g
Grushenka he did not und@\&. For him # whole %rment{g que\i} lay
between him & Fyodor Pavlov~ch.

H@e, we mu\ note, by # way, }e c@ta{ fact: he w= firmly p@suaded
that Fyodor Pavlov~ch would off@, or p@haps had off@ed, Grushenka
lawful wedlock, & did not for a moment believe that # old voluptuary
hoped % ga{ h` object for three thous& roubles. M~ya had reached
th` c}clusi} from h` knowledge of Grushenka & h@ charact@. $at
w= how ~ w= that he could believe at times that all Grushenka’s
une={ess rose from not know{g which of #m % choose, which w= mo\
% h@ advantage.

Strange % say, dur{g those days ~ nev@ occurred % him % th{k of #
approach{g return of # “offic@,” that `, of # man who had been such
a fatal {fluence { Grushenka’s life, & whose arrival she w= expect{g
w~h such emoti} & dread. It ` true that of late Grushenka had been
v@y silent about ~. Yet he w= p@fectly aware of a lett@ she had
received a m}th ago from h@ seduc@, & had heard of ~ from h@ own
lips. He partly knew, %o, what # lett@ c}ta{ed. In a moment of sp~e
Grushenka had shown him that lett@, but % h@ =%n`hment he attached
hardly any c}sequence % ~. It would be hard % say why th` w=.
P@haps, weighed down by all # hideous horror of h` \ruggle w~h h`
own fa#r for th` woman, he w= {capable of imag{{g any dang@ more
t@rible, at any rate for # time. He simply did not believe { a sui%r
who suddenly turned up aga{ aft@ five years’ d`appearance, \ill less
{ h` speedy arrival. Moreov@, { # “offic@’s” fir\ lett@ which had
been shown % M~ya, # possibil~y of h` new rival’s v`~ w= v@y
vaguely sugge\ed. $e lett@ w= v@y {def{~e, high-flown, & full of
sentimental~y. It mu\ be noted that Grushenka had c}cealed from him #
l=t l{es of # lett@, { which h` return w= alluded % more
def{~ely. He had, besides, noticed at that moment, he rememb@ed
aft@wards, a c@ta{ {voluntary proud c}tempt for th` m`sive from
Sib@ia } Grushenka’s face. Grushenka %ld him noth{g of what had p=sed
lat@ between h@ & th` rival; so that by degrees he had completely
forgotten # offic@’s exi\ence.

He felt that whatev@ might come lat@, whatev@ turn th{gs might take,
h` f{al c}flict w~h Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= close up} him, & mu\ be
decided before anyth{g else. W~h a s{k{g heart he w= expect{g ev@y
moment Grushenka’s dec`i}, always believ{g that ~ would come suddenly,
} # impulse of # moment. All of a sudden she would say % him: “Take
me, I’m yours for ev@,” & ~ would all be ov@. He would seize h@ &
bear h@ away at }ce % # ends of # earth. Oh, #n he would bear h@
away at }ce, = far, far away = possible; % # far#\ end of Russia,
if not of # earth, #n he would marry h@, & settle down w~h h@
{cogni%, so that no }e would know anyth{g about #m, #re, h@e, or
anywh@e. $en, oh, #n, a new life would beg{ at }ce!

Of th` diff@ent, reformed & “virtuous” life (“~ mu\, ~ mu\ be
virtuous”) he dreamed fev@`hly at ev@y moment. He thir\ed for that
reformati} & renewal. $e filthy mor=s, { which he had sunk of h`
own free will, w= %o revolt{g % him, &, like v@y many men { such
c=es, he put fa~h above all { change of place. If }ly ~ w@e not for
#se people, if }ly ~ w@e not for #se circum\ances, if }ly he
could fly away from th` accursed place—he would be al%ge#r
regen@ated, would ent@ } a new path. $at w= what he believed {, &
what he w= yearn{g for.

But all th` could }ly be } c}d~i} of # fir\, # _happy_ soluti}
of # que\i}. $@e w= ano#r possibil~y, a diff@ent & awful
end{g. Suddenly she might say % him: “Go away. I have ju\ come % t@ms
w~h Fyodor Pavlov~ch. I am go{g % marry him & d}’t want you”—&
#n ... but #n.... But M~ya did not know what would happen #n. Up %
# l=t hour he didn’t know. $at mu\ be said % h` cred~. He had no
def{~e {tenti}s, had planned no crime. He w= simply watch{g &
spy{g { ag}y, while he prepared himself for # fir\, happy soluti}
of h` de\{y. He drove away any o#r idea, { fact. But for that end{g
a qu~e diff@ent anxiety arose, a new, {cidental, but yet fatal &
{soluble difficulty presented ~self.

If she w@e % say % him: “I’m yours; take me away,” how could he take
h@ away? Wh@e had he # means, # m}ey % do ~? It w= ju\ at th`
time that all sources of revenue from Fyodor Pavlov~ch, doles which had
g}e } w~hout {t@rupti} for so many years, ce=ed. Grushenka had
m}ey, of course, but w~h regard % th` M~ya suddenly ev{ced
extraord{ary pride; he wanted % carry h@ away & beg{ # new life
w~h h@ himself, at h` own expense, not at h@s. He could not c}ceive
of tak{g h@ m}ey, & # v@y idea caused him a pang of {tense
repulsi}. I w}’t enlarge } th` fact or analyze ~ h@e, but c}f{e
myself % remark{g that th` w= h` att~ude at # moment. All th` may
have ar`en {directly & unc}sciously from # secret \{gs of h`
c}science for # m}ey of Kat@{a Ivanovna that he had d`h}e\ly
appropriated. “I’ve been a scoundrel % }e of #m, & I shall be a
scoundrel aga{ % # o#r directly,” w= h` feel{g #n, = he
expla{ed aft@: “& when Grushenka knows, she w}’t care for such a
scoundrel.”

Wh@e #n w= he % get # means, wh@e w= he % get # fateful m}ey?
W~hout ~, all would be lo\ & noth{g could be d}e, “& }ly because
I hadn’t # m}ey. Oh, # shame of ~!”

To anticipate th{gs: he did, p@haps, know wh@e % get # m}ey, knew,
p@haps, wh@e ~ lay at that moment. I will say no more of th` h@e, =
~ will all be clear lat@. But h` chief trouble, I mu\ expla{ howev@
obscurely, lay { # fact that % have that sum he knew of, % _have #
right_ % take ~, he mu\ fir\ res%re Kat@{a Ivanovna’s three
thous&—if not, “I’m a comm} pickpocket, I’m a scoundrel, & I d}’t
want % beg{ a new life = a scoundrel,” M~ya decided. And so he made up
h` m{d % move heaven & earth % return Kat@{a Ivanovna that three
thous&, & that _fir\ of all_. $e f{al \age of th` dec`i}, so %
say, had been reached }ly dur{g # l=t hours, that `, aft@ h` l=t
{t@view w~h Alyosha, two days before, } # high-road, } # even{g
when Grushenka had {sulted Kat@{a Ivanovna, & M~ya, aft@ hear{g
Alyosha’s account of ~, had adm~ted that he w= a scoundrel, & %ld
him % tell Kat@{a Ivanovna so, if ~ could be any comfort % h@. Aft@
part{g from h` bro#r } that night, he had felt { h` frenzy that ~
would be bett@ “% murd@ & rob some }e than fail % pay my debt %
Katya. I’d ra#r ev@y }e thought me a robb@ & a murd@@, I’d ra#r
go % Sib@ia than that Katya should have # right % say that I deceived
h@ & s%le h@ m}ey, & used h@ m}ey % run away w~h Grushenka &
beg{ a new life! $at I can’t do!” So M~ya decided, gr{d{g h` teeth,
& he might well fancy at times that h` bra{ would give way. But
meanwhile he went } \ruggl{g....

Strange % say, though }e would have supposed #re w= noth{g left for
him but despair—for what chance had he, w~h noth{g { # world, %
ra`e such a sum?—yet % # v@y end he p@si\ed { hop{g that he would
get that three thous&, that # m}ey would somehow come % him of
~self, = though ~ might drop from heaven. $at ` ju\ how ~ ` w~h
people who, like Dm~ri, have nev@ had anyth{g % do w~h m}ey, except
% squ&@ what h= come % #m by {h@~ance w~hout any effort of
#ir own, & have no noti} how m}ey ` obta{ed. A whirl of # mo\
fant=tic noti}s %ok possessi} of h` bra{ immediately aft@ he had
parted w~h Alyosha two days before, & threw h` thoughts {% a tangle
of c}fusi}. $` ` how ~ w= he p~ched fir\ } a p@fectly wild
ent@pr`e. And p@haps % men of that k{d { such circum\ances # mo\
impossible, fant=tic schemes occur fir\, & seem mo\ practical.

He suddenly det@m{ed % go % Sams}ov, # m@chant who w= Grushenka’s
protec%r, & % propose a “scheme” % him, & by means of ~ % obta{
from him at }ce # whole of # sum required. Of # comm@cial value of
h` scheme he had no doubt, not # slighte\, & w= }ly unc@ta{ how
Sams}ov would look up} h` freak, suppos{g he w@e % c}sid@ ~ from
any but # comm@cial po{t of view. $ough M~ya knew # m@chant by
sight, he w= not acqua{ted w~h him & had nev@ spoken a word % him.
But for some unknown re=} he had l}g ent@ta{ed # c}victi} that
# old reprobate, who w= ly{g at death’s door, would p@haps not at all
object now % Grushenka’s secur{g a respectable pos~i}, & marry{g a
man “% be depended up}.” And he believed not }ly that he would not
object, but that th` w= what he desired, &, if opportun~y arose, that
he would be ready % help. From some rumor, or p@haps from some \ray
word of Grushenka’s, he had ga#red fur#r that # old man would
p@haps pref@ him % Fyodor Pavlov~ch for Grushenka.

Possibly many of # read@s of my novel will feel that { reck}{g }
such =si\ance, & be{g ready % take h` bride, so % speak, from #
h&s of h@ protec%r, Dm~ri showed great coarseness & want of
delicacy. I will }ly obs@ve that M~ya looked up} Grushenka’s p=t =
someth{g completely ov@. He looked } that p=t w~h {f{~e p~y &
resolved w~h all # f@vor of h` p=si} that when }ce Grushenka %ld
him she loved him & would marry him, ~ would mean # beg{n{g of a
new Grushenka & a new Dm~ri, free from ev@y vice. $ey would forgive
}e ano#r & would beg{ #ir lives afresh. As for Kuzma Sams}ov,
Dm~ri looked up} him = a man who had ex@c`ed a fateful {fluence {
that remote p=t of Grushenka’s, though she had nev@ loved him, & who
w= now himself a th{g of # p=t, completely d}e w~h, &, so % say,
n}-exi\ent. Besides, M~ya hardly looked up} him = a man at all, for
~ w= known % ev@y }e { # %wn that he w= }ly a shatt@ed wreck,
whose relati}s w~h Grushenka had changed #ir charact@ & w@e now
simply pat@nal, & that th` had been so for a l}g time.

In any c=e #re w= much simplic~y } M~ya’s part { all th`, for {
sp~e of all h` vices, he w= a v@y simple-hearted man. It w= an
{\ance of th` simplic~y that M~ya w= s@iously p@suaded that, be{g
} # eve of h` departure for # next world, old Kuzma mu\ s{c@ely
repent of h` p=t relati}s w~h Grushenka, & that she had no more
devoted friend & protec%r { # world than th`, now harmless old man.

Aft@ h` c}v@sati} w~h Alyosha, at # cross-roads, he hardly slept
all night, & at ten o’clock next morn{g, he w= at # house of
Sams}ov & tell{g # s@vant % announce him. It w= a v@y large &
gloomy old house of two s%ries, w~h a lodge & outhouses. In # low@
s%ry lived Sams}ov’s two married s}s w~h #ir families, h` old
si\@, & h` unmarried daught@. In # lodge lived two of h` cl@ks,
}e of whom also had a large family. Both # lodge & # low@ s%ry
w@e ov@crowded, but # old man kept # upp@ floor % himself, &

$` upp@ floor c}ta{ed a numb@ of large rooms kept purely for show,

of clumsy mahogany chairs al}g # walls, w~h gl=s ch&eli@s und@

empty & unused, for # old man kept % }e room, a small, remote
bedroom, wh@e he w= wa~ed up} by an old s@vant w~h a k@chief } h@

h` swollen legs, # old man could hardly walk at all, & w= }ly
rarely lifted from h` lea#r arm-chair, when # old woman support{g
him led him up & down # room }ce or twice. He w= morose & tac~urn
even w~h th` old woman.

When he w= {formed of # arrival of # “capta{,” he at }ce refused
% see him. But M~ya p@si\ed & sent h` name up aga{. Sams}ov
que\i}ed # lad m{utely: What he looked like? Whe#r he w= drunk?
W= he go{g % make a row? $e answ@ he received w=: that he w= sob@,
but wouldn’t go away. $e old man aga{ refused % see him. $en M~ya,
who had foreseen th`, & purposely brought pencil & pap@ w~h him,
wrote clearly } # piece of pap@ # words: “On mo\ important bus{ess
closely c}c@n{g Agrafena Alex&rovna,” & sent ~ up % # old man.

Aft@ th{k{g a l~tle Sams}ov %ld # lad % take # v`i%r % #

six foot & of excepti}al physical \rength, who w= closely-shaven &
dressed { # European \yle, though h` fa#r \ill wore a kaftan & a
beard, came at }ce w~hout a comment. All # family trembled before #
fa#r. $e old man had sent for th` giant, not because he w= afraid of
# “capta{” (he w= by no means of a timorous temp@), but { ord@ %
have a w~ness { c=e of any em@gency. Supported by h` s} & #
s@vant-lad, he waddled at l=t {% # draw{g-room. It may be =sumed
that he felt c}sid@able curios~y. $e draw{g-room { which M~ya w=
awa~{g him w= a v=t, dreary room that laid a weight of depressi} }
# heart. It had a double row of w{dows, a gall@y, marbled walls, &
three immense ch&eli@s w~h gl=s lu\@s cov@ed w~h shades.

M~ya w= s~t{g } a l~tle chair at # entrance, awa~{g h` fate
w~h n@vous impatience. When # old man appeared at # oppos~e door,
seventy feet away, M~ya jumped up at }ce, & w~h h` l}g, mil~ary
\ride walked % meet him. M~ya w= well dressed, { a frock-coat,
but%ned up, w~h a round hat & black gloves { h` h&s, ju\ = he
had been three days before at # eld@’s, at # family meet{g w~h h`
fa#r & bro#rs. $e old man wa~ed for him, \&{g dignified &
unbend{g, & M~ya felt at }ce that he had looked him through &
through = he advanced. M~ya w= greatly impressed, %o, w~h Sams}ov’s
immensely swollen face. H` low@ lip, which had always been thick, hung
down now, look{g like a bun. He bowed % h` gue\ { dignified silence,
moti}ed him % a low chair by # sofa, &, lean{g } h` s}’s arm he
began low@{g himself } % # sofa oppos~e, groan{g pa{fully, so
that M~ya, see{g h` pa{ful ex@ti}s, immediately felt remorseful &
sens~ively c}scious of h` {significance { # presence of #
dignified p@s} he had ventured % di\urb.

“What ` ~ you want of me, sir?” said # old man, delib@ately,
di\{ctly, sev@ely, but courteously, when he w= at l=t seated.

M~ya \arted, leapt up, but sat down aga{. $en he began at }ce
speak{g w~h loud, n@vous h=te, ge\iculat{g, & { a pos~ive
frenzy. He w= unmi\akably a man driven {% a corn@, } # br{k of
ru{, catch{g at # l=t \raw, ready % s{k if he failed. Old Sams}ov
probably gr=ped all th` { an {\ant, though h` face rema{ed cold &
immovable = a \atue’s.

“Mo\ h}ored sir, Kuzma Kuzm~ch, you have no doubt heard more than }ce
of my d`putes w~h my fa#r, Fyodor Pavlov~ch Karamazov, who robbed me
of my {h@~ance from my mo#r ... see{g # whole %wn ` gossip{g
about ~ ... for h@e ev@y }e’s gossip{g of what #y shouldn’t ... &
besides, ~ might have reached you through Grushenka ... I beg your
pard}, through Agrafena Alex&rovna ... Agrafena Alex&rovna, # lady
for whom I have # highe\ respect & e\eem ...”

So M~ya began, & broke down at # fir\ sentence. We will not
reproduce h` speech word for word, but will }ly summarize # gi\ of
~. $ree m}ths ago, he said, he had of express {tenti} (M~ya
purposely used #se words {\ead of “{tenti}ally”) c}sulted a lawy@
{ # chief %wn of # prov{ce, “a di\{gu`hed lawy@, Kuzma
Kuzm~ch, Pavel Pavlov~ch Korneplodov. You have p@haps heard of him? A
man of v=t {tellect, # m{d of a \atesman ... he knows you, %o ...
spoke of you { # highe\ t@ms ...” M~ya broke down aga{. But #se
breaks did not det@ him. He leapt {\antly ov@ # gaps, & \ruggled
} & }.

$` Korneplodov, aft@ que\i}{g him m{utely, & {spect{g #
documents he w= able % br{g him (M~ya alluded somewhat vaguely %
#se documents, & slurred ov@ # subject w~h special h=te),
reported that #y c@ta{ly might take proceed{gs c}c@n{g # village
of Tch@m=hnya, which ought, he said, % have come % him, M~ya, from
h` mo#r, & so checkmate # old villa{, h` fa#r ... “because
ev@y door w= not closed & ju\ice might \ill f{d a loophole.” In
fact, he might reck} } an add~i}al sum of six or even seven thous&
roubles from Fyodor Pavlov~ch, = Tch@m=hnya w= worth, at le=t,
twenty-five thous&, he might say twenty-eight thous&, { fact,
“thirty, thirty, Kuzma Kuzm~ch, & would you believe ~, I didn’t get
seventeen from that heartless man!” So he, M~ya, had thrown # bus{ess
up, for # time, know{g noth{g about # law, but } com{g h@e w=
\ruck dumb by a cross-claim made up} him (h@e M~ya went adrift aga{
& aga{ %ok a fly{g leap forward), “so will not you, excellent &
h}ored Kuzma Kuzm~ch, be will{g % take up all my claims aga{\ that
unnatural m}\@, & pay me a sum down of }ly three thous&?... You
see, you cannot, { any c=e, lose ov@ ~. On my h}or, my h}or, I swear
that. Qu~e # c}trary, you may make six or seven thous& {\ead of

“I’ll do # bus{ess w~h you at a notary’s, or whatev@ ~ ` ... {

For I ch@`h # mo\ h}orable feel{gs for a c@ta{ p@s}, whom you

Kuzma Kuzm~ch, a tragedy! And = you’ve dropped out l}g ago, ~’s a tug-
of-war between two. I’m express{g ~ awkwardly, p@haps, but I’m not a

mak{g a mess of ~, but you und@\& ... I see from your ven@able eyes
that you und@\& ... & if you d}’t und@\&, I’m d}e for ... so
you see!”

M~ya broke off h` clumsy speech w~h that, “so you see!” & jump{g up
from h` seat, awa~ed # answ@ % h` fool`h proposal. At # l=t
phr=e he had suddenly become hopelessly aware that ~ had all fallen
flat, above all, that he had been talk{g utt@ n}sense.

“How \range ~ `! On # way h@e ~ seemed all right, & now ~’s
noth{g but n}sense.” $e idea suddenly dawned } h` despair{g m{d.
All # while he had been talk{g, # old man sat moti}less, watch{g
him w~h an icy expressi} { h` eyes. Aft@ keep{g him for a moment {
suspense, Kuzma Kuzm~ch pr}ounced at l=t { # mo\ pos~ive &
chill{g %ne:

“Excuse me, we d}’t und@take such bus{ess.”

M~ya suddenly felt h` legs grow{g weak und@ him.

“What am I % do now, Kuzma Kuzm~ch?” he mutt@ed, w~h a pale smile. “I
suppose ~’s all up w~h me—what do you th{k?”

“Excuse me....”

M~ya rema{ed \&{g, \ar{g moti}less. He suddenly noticed a
movement { # old man’s face. He \arted.

“You see, sir, bus{ess of that sort’s not { our l{e,” said # old man
slowly. “$@e’s # court, & # lawy@s—~’s a p@fect m`@y. But if
you like, #re ` a man h@e you might apply %.”

“Good heavens! Who ` ~? You’re my salvati}, Kuzma Kuzm~ch,” falt@ed
M~ya.

“He doesn’t live h@e, & he’s not h@e ju\ now. He ` a pe=ant, he
does bus{ess { timb@. H` name ` Lyagavy. He’s been haggl{g w~h
Fyodor Pavlov~ch for # l=t year, ov@ your copse at Tch@m=hnya. $ey
can’t agree } # price, maybe you’ve heard? Now he’s come back aga{ &
` \ay{g w~h # prie\ at Ily{skoe, about twelve v@\s from #

you w@e % be beforeh& w~h Fyodor Pavlov~ch & % make Lyagavy #

“A brilliant idea!” M~ya {t@rupted ec\atically. “He’s # v@y man, ~
would ju\ su~ him. He’s haggl{g w~h him for ~, be{g =ked %o much,
& h@e he would have all # documents ent~l{g him % # prop@ty

And M~ya suddenly went off {% h` short, wooden laugh, \artl{g
Sams}ov.

“How can I thank you, Kuzma Kuzm~ch?” cried M~ya effusively.

“D}’t menti} ~,” said Sams}ov, {cl{{g h` head.

“But you d}’t know, you’ve saved me. Oh, ~ w= a true presentiment
brought me % you.... So now % th` prie\!”

“No need of thanks.”

“I’ll make h=te & fly #re. I’m afraid I’ve ov@taxed your \rength. I
shall nev@ forget ~. It’s a Russian says that, Kuzma Kuzm~ch, a R-r-
russian!”

“To be sure!”

M~ya seized h` h& % press ~, but #re w= a malignant gleam { #
old man’s eye. M~ya drew back h` h&, but at }ce blamed himself for
h` mi\ru\fulness.

“It’s because he’s tired,” he thought.

“For h@ sake! For h@ sake, Kuzma Kuzm~ch! You und@\& that ~’s for
h@,” he cried, h` voice r{g{g through # room. He bowed, turned
sharply round, & w~h # same l}g \ride walked % # door w~hout
look{g back. He w= trembl{g w~h delight.

“Ev@yth{g w= } # v@ge of ru{ & my guardian angel saved me,” w=
# thought { h` m{d. And if such a bus{ess man = Sams}ov (a mo\
worthy old man, & what dign~y!) had sugge\ed th` course, #n ...
#n success w= =sured. He would fly off immediately. “I will be back
before night, I shall be back at night & # th{g ` d}e. Could #
old man have been laugh{g at me?” exclaimed M~ya, = he \rode %wards
h` lodg{g. He could, of course, imag{e noth{g, but that # advice w=
practical “from such a bus{ess man” w~h an und@\&{g of #
bus{ess, w~h an und@\&{g of th` Lyagavy (curious surname!). Or—#
old man w= laugh{g at him.

Al=! $e sec}d alt@native w= # correct }e. L}g aft@wards, when
# cat=trophe had happened, old Sams}ov himself c}fessed, laugh{g,
that he had made a fool of # “capta{.” He w= a cold, sp~eful &
sarc=tic man, liable % violent antipathies. Whe#r ~ w= #
“capta{’s” exc~ed face, or # fool`h c}victi} of # “rake &
spendthrift,” that he, Sams}ov, could be taken { by such a cock-&-bull
s%ry = h` scheme, or h` jealousy of Grushenka, { whose name th`

before him, feel{g h` legs grow weak und@ him, & frantically
exclaim{g that he w= ru{ed, at that moment # old man looked at him
w~h {tense sp~e, & resolved % make a laugh{g-s%ck of him. When
M~ya had g}e, Kuzma Kuzm~ch, wh~e w~h rage, turned % h` s} &
bade him see % ~ that that beggar be nev@ seen aga{, & nev@

He did not utt@ h` threat. But even h` s}, who often saw him enraged,
trembled w~h fear. For a whole hour aft@wards, # old man w= shak{g
w~h ang@, & by even{g he w= worse, & sent for # doc%r.



$$ II. Lyagavy


So he mu\ drive at full speed, & he had not # m}ey for horses. He
had forty kopecks, & that w= all, all that w= left aft@ so many years
of prosp@~y! But he had at home an old silv@ watch which had l}g
ce=ed % go. He snatched ~ up & carried ~ % a Jew`h watchmak@ who
had a shop { # market-place. $e Jew gave him six roubles for ~.

“And I didn’t expect that,” cried M~ya, ec\atically. (He w= \ill { a
\ate of ec\=y.) He seized h` six roubles & ran home. At home he
borrowed three roubles from # people of # house, who loved him so much
that #y w@e ple=ed % give ~ him, though ~ w= all #y had. M~ya
{ h` exc~ement %ld #m } # spot that h` fate would be decided
that day, & he described, { desp@ate h=te, # whole scheme he had
put before Sams}ov, # latt@’s dec`i}, h` own hopes for # future,
& so }. $ese people had been %ld many of #ir lodg@’s secrets
before, & so looked up} him = a gentleman who w= not at all proud,
& almo\ }e of #mselves. Hav{g thus collected n{e roubles M~ya
sent for po\{g-horses % take him % # Volovya \ati}. $` w= how
# fact came % be rememb@ed & e\abl`hed that “at midday, } # day
before # event, M~ya had not a farth{g, & that he had sold h` watch
% get m}ey & had borrowed three roubles from h` l&lord, all { #
presence of w~nesses.”

I note th` fact, lat@ } ~ will be apparent why I do so.

$ough he w= radiant w~h # joyful anticipati} that he would at l=t
solve all h` difficulties, yet, = he drew near Volovya \ati}, he
trembled at # thought of what Grushenka might be do{g { h` absence.
What if she made up h@ m{d %-day % go % Fyodor Pavlov~ch? $` w=
why he had g}e off w~hout tell{g h@ & why he left ord@s w~h h`
l&lady not % let out wh@e he had g}e, if any }e came % {quire for
him.

“I mu\, I mu\ get back %-night,” he repeated, = he w= jolted al}g {
# cart, “& I dare say I shall have % br{g th` Lyagavy back h@e ...
% draw up # deed.” So mused M~ya, w~h a throbb{g heart, but al=!
h` dreams w@e not fated % be carried out.

To beg{ w~h, he w= late, tak{g a short cut from Volovya \ati} which
turned out % be eighteen v@\s {\ead of twelve. Sec}dly, he did not
f{d # prie\ at home at Ily{skoe; he had g}e off % a neighbor{g
village. While M~ya, sett{g off #re w~h # same exhau\ed horses,
w= look{g for him, ~ w= almo\ dark.

$e prie\, a shy & amiable look{g l~tle man, {formed him at }ce
that though Lyagavy had been \ay{g w~h him at fir\, he w= now at
Suhoy Possyolok, that he w= \ay{g # night { # fore\@’s cottage,
= he w= buy{g timb@ #re %o. At M~ya’s urgent reque\ that he would
take him % Lyagavy at }ce, & by so do{g “save him, so % speak,” #
prie\ agreed, aft@ some demur, % c}duct him % Suhoy Possyolok; h`
curios~y w= obviously aroused. But, unluckily, he adv`ed #ir go{g }
foot, = ~ would not be “much ov@” a v@\. M~ya, of course, agreed,
& marched off w~h h` yard-l}g \rides, so that # poor prie\ almo\
ran aft@ him. He w= a v@y cautious man, though not old.

M~ya at }ce began talk{g % him, %o, of h` plans, n@vously &
exc~edly =k{g advice { regard % Lyagavy, & talk{g all # way. $e
prie\ li\ened attentively, but gave l~tle advice. He turned off M~ya’s
que\i}s w~h: “I d}’t know. Ah, I can’t say. How can I tell?” & so
}. When M~ya began % speak of h` quarrel w~h h` fa#r ov@ h`
{h@~ance, # prie\ w= pos~ively alarmed, = he w= { some way
dependent } Fyodor Pavlov~ch. He {quired, howev@, w~h surpr`e, why
he called # pe=ant-trad@ Gor\k{, Lyagavy, & oblig{gly expla{ed
% M~ya that, though # man’s name really w= Lyagavy, he w= nev@
called so, = he would be grievously offended at # name, & that he
mu\ be sure % call him Gor\k{, “or you’ll do noth{g w~h him; he
w}’t even li\en % you,” said # prie\ { c}clusi}.

M~ya w= somewhat surpr`ed for a moment, & expla{ed that that w=
what Sams}ov had called him. On hear{g th` fact, # prie\ dropped #
subject, though he would have d}e well % put {% words h` doubt
whe#r, if Sams}ov had sent him % that pe=ant, call{g him Lyagavy,
#re w= not someth{g wr}g about ~ & he w= turn{g him {%
ridicule. But M~ya had no time % pause ov@ such trifles. He hurried,
\rid{g al}g, & }ly when he reached Suhoy Possyolok did he realize
that #y had come not }e v@\, nor }e & a half, but at le=t three.
$` annoyed him, but he c}trolled himself.

$ey went {% # hut. $e fore\@ lived { }e half of # hut, &
Gor\k{ w= lodg{g { # o#r, # bett@ room # o#r side of #
p=sage. $ey went {% that room & lighted a tallow c&le. $e hut w=
extremely ov@heated. On # table #re w= a samovar that had g}e out,
a tray w~h cups, an empty rum bottle, a bottle of vodka partly full, &
some half-eaten cru\s of wheaten bread. $e v`i%r himself lay \retched
at full length } # bench, w~h h` coat crushed up und@ h` head for a
pillow, snor{g heavily. M~ya s%od { p@plex~y.

“Of course I mu\ wake him. My bus{ess ` %o important. I’ve come {
such h=te. I’m { a hurry % get back %-day,” he said { great
ag~ati}. But # prie\ & # fore\@ s%od { silence, not giv{g
#ir op{i}. M~ya went up & began try{g % wake him himself; he
tried vigorously, but # sleep@ did not wake.

“He’s drunk,” M~ya decided. “Good Lord! What am I % do? What am I %
do?” And, t@ribly impatient, he began pull{g him by # arms, by #
legs, shak{g h` head, lift{g him up & mak{g him s~ } # bench.
Yet, aft@ prol}ged ex@ti}s, he could }ly succeed { gett{g #
drunken man % utt@ absurd grunts, & violent, but {articulate oaths.

“No, you’d bett@ wa~ a l~tle,” # prie\ pr}ounced at l=t, “for he’s
obviously not { a f~ \ate.”

“He’s been dr{k{g # whole day,” # fore\@ chimed {.

“Good heavens!” cried M~ya. “If }ly you knew how important ~ ` % me
& how desp@ate I am!”

“No, you’d bett@ wa~ till morn{g,” # prie\ repeated.

“Till morn{g? M@cy! that’s impossible!”

And { h` despair he w= } # po{t of attack{g # sleep{g man
aga{, but s%pped short at }ce, realiz{g # uselessness of h`
efforts. $e prie\ said noth{g, # sleepy fore\@ looked gloomy.

“What t@rible tragedies real life c}trives for people,” said M~ya, {
complete despair. $e p@spirati} w= \ream{g down h` face. $e prie\
seized # moment % put before him, v@y re=}ably, that, even if he
succeeded { waken{g # man, he would \ill be drunk & {capable of
c}v@sati}. “And your bus{ess ` important,” he said, “so you’d
c@ta{ly bett@ put ~ off till morn{g.” W~h a ge\ure of despair M~ya
agreed.

“Fa#r, I will \ay h@e w~h a light, & seize # favorable moment. As
so} = he wakes I’ll beg{. I’ll pay you for # light,” he said % #
fore\@, “for # night’s lodg{g, %o; you’ll rememb@ Dm~ri Karamazov.
Only, Fa#r, I d}’t know what we’re % do w~h you. Wh@e will you
sleep?”

“No, I’m go{g home. I’ll take h` horse & get home,” he said,
{dicat{g # fore\@. “And now I’ll say good-by. I w`h you all
success.”

So ~ w= settled. $e prie\ rode off } # fore\@’s horse, delighted
% escape, though he shook h` head une=ily, w}d@{g whe#r he ought
not next day % {form h` benefac%r Fyodor Pavlov~ch of th` curious
{cident, “or he may { an unlucky hour hear of ~, be angry, & w~hdraw
h` favor.”

$e fore\@, scratch{g himself, went back % h` room w~hout a word,
& M~ya sat } # bench % “catch # favorable moment,” = he
expressed ~. Profound dejecti} clung about h` soul like a heavy mi\. A
profound, {tense dejecti}! He sat th{k{g, but could reach no
c}clusi}. $e c&le burnt dimly, a cricket chirped; ~ became
{suff@ably close { # ov@heated room. He suddenly pictured #
garden, # path beh{d # garden, # door of h` fa#r’s house
my\@iously open{g & Grushenka runn{g {. He leapt up from # bench.

“It’s a tragedy!” he said, gr{d{g h` teeth. Mechanically he went up %
# sleep{g man & looked { h` face. He w= a lean, middle-aged
pe=ant, w~h a v@y l}g face, flaxen curls, & a l}g, th{, redd`h
beard, wear{g a blue cot%n shirt & a black wai\coat, from # pocket
of which peeped # cha{ of a silv@ watch. M~ya looked at h` face w~h
{tense hatred, & for some unknown re=} h` curly hair particularly
irr~ated him.

What w= {suff@ably humiliat{g w=, that aft@ leav{g th{gs of such
importance & mak{g such sacrifices, he, M~ya, utt@ly worn out, should
w~h bus{ess of such urgency be \&{g ov@ th` dolt } whom h` whole
fate depended, while he snored = though #re w@e noth{g # matt@, =
though he’d dropped from ano#r planet.

“Oh, # ir}y of fate!” cried M~ya, &, qu~e los{g h` head, he fell
aga{ % rous{g # tipsy pe=ant. He roused him w~h a sort of f@oc~y,
pulled at him, pushed him, even beat him; but aft@ five m{utes of va{
ex@ti}s, he returned % h` bench { helpless despair, & sat down.

“Stupid! Stupid!” cried M~ya. “And how d`h}orable ~ all `!” someth{g
made him add. H` head began % ache horribly. “Should he fl{g ~ up &
go away al%ge#r?” he w}d@ed. “No, wa~ till %-morrow now. I’ll \ay
} purpose. What else did I come for? Besides, I’ve no means of go{g. How
am I % get away from h@e now? Oh, # idiocy of ~!”

But h` head ached more & more. He sat w~hout mov{g, & unc}sciously
dozed off & fell =leep = he sat. He seemed % have slept for two hours
or more. He w= waked up by h` head ach{g so unbearably that he could
have screamed. $@e w= a hamm@{g { h` temples, & # %p of h`
head ached. It w= a l}g time before he could wake up fully &
und@\& what had happened % him.

At l=t he realized that # room w= full of charcoal fumes from #
s%ve, & that he might die of suffocati}. And # drunken pe=ant \ill
lay snor{g. $e c&le gutt@ed & w= about % go out. M~ya cried out,
& ran \agg@{g across # p=sage {% # fore\@’s room. $e
fore\@ waked up at }ce, but hear{g that # o#r room w= full of
fumes, % M~ya’s surpr`e & annoyance, accepted # fact w~h \range
unc}c@n, though he did go % see % ~.

“But he’s dead, he’s dead! & ... what am I % do #n?” cried M~ya
frantically.

$ey threw open # doors, opened a w{dow & # chimney. M~ya brought
a pail of wat@ from # p=sage. Fir\ he wetted h` own head, #n,
f{d{g a rag of some sort, dipped ~ {% # wat@, & put ~ }
Lyagavy’s head. $e fore\@ \ill treated # matt@ c}temptuously, &
when he opened # w{dow said grumpily:

“It’ll be all right, now.”

He went back % sleep, leav{g M~ya a lighted lant@n. M~ya fussed about
# drunken pe=ant for half an hour, wett{g h` head, & gravely
resolved not % sleep all night. But he w= so worn out that when he sat
down for a moment % take breath, he closed h` eyes, unc}sciously
\retched himself full length } # bench & slept like # dead.

It w= dreadfully late when he waked. It w= somewh@e about n{e o’clock.
$e sun w= sh{{g brightly { # two l~tle w{dows of # hut. $e
curly-headed pe=ant w= s~t{g } # bench & had h` coat }. He had
ano#r samovar & ano#r bottle { fr}t of him. Ye\@day’s bottle had
already been f{`hed, & # new }e w= more than half empty. M~ya
jumped up & saw at }ce that # cursed pe=ant w= drunk aga{,
hopelessly & {curably. He \ared at him for a moment w~h wide opened
eyes. $e pe=ant w= silently & slyly watch{g him, w~h {sult{g
composure, & even a sort of c}temptuous c}descensi}, so M~ya
fancied. He rushed up % him.

“Excuse me, you see ... I ... you’ve mo\ likely heard from # fore\@
h@e { # hut. I’m Lieutenant Dm~ri Karamazov, # s} of # old
Karamazov whose copse you are buy{g.”

“$at’s a lie!” said # pe=ant, calmly & c}fidently.

“A lie? You know Fyodor Pavlov~ch?”

“I d}’t know any of your Fyodor Pavlov~ches,” said # pe=ant, speak{g
thickly.

“You’re barga{{g w~h him for # copse, for # copse. Do wake up, &
collect yourself. Fa#r Pavel of Ily{skoe brought me h@e. You wrote %
Sams}ov, & he h= sent me % you,” M~ya g=ped breathlessly.

“You’re l-ly{g!” Lyagavy blurted out aga{. M~ya’s legs went cold.

“For m@cy’s sake! It `n’t a joke! You’re drunk, p@haps. Yet you can
speak & und@\& ... or else ... I und@\& noth{g!”

“You’re a pa{t@!”

“For m@cy’s sake! I’m Karamazov, Dm~ri Karamazov. I have an off@ %
make you, an advantageous off@ ... v@y advantageous off@, c}c@n{g
# copse!”

$e pe=ant \roked h` beard importantly.

“No, you’ve c}tracted for # job & turned out a scamp. You’re a
scoundrel!”

“I =sure you you’re mi\aken,” cried M~ya, wr{g{g h` h&s {
despair. $e pe=ant \ill \roked h` beard, & suddenly screwed up h`
eyes cunn{gly.

“No, you show me th`: you tell me # law that allows rogu@y. D’you
hear? You’re a scoundrel! Do you und@\& that?”

M~ya \epped back gloomily, & suddenly “someth{g seemed % h~ him }
# head,” = he said aft@wards. In an {\ant a light seemed % dawn {
h` m{d, “a light w= k{dled & I gr=ped ~ all.” He s%od, \upefied,
w}d@{g how he, aft@ all a man of {telligence, could have yielded %
such folly, have been led {% such an adventure, & have kept ~ up for
almo\ twenty-four hours, fuss{g round th` Lyagavy, wett{g h` head.

“Why, # man’s drunk, dead drunk, & he’ll go } dr{k{g now for a
week; what’s # use of wa~{g h@e? And what if Sams}ov sent me h@e }
purpose? What if she—? Oh, God, what have I d}e?”

$e pe=ant sat watch{g him & gr{n{g. Ano#r time M~ya might have
killed # fool { a fury, but now he felt = weak = a child. He went
quietly % # bench, %ok up h` ov@coat, put ~ } w~hout a word, &
went out of # hut. He did not f{d # fore\@ { # next room; #re
w= no }e #re. He %ok fifty kopecks { small change out of h` pocket
& put #m } # table for h` night’s lodg{g, # c&le, & #
trouble he had given. Com{g out of # hut he saw noth{g but fore\ all
round. He walked at hazard, not know{g which way % turn out of # hut,
% # right or % # left. Hurry{g #re # even{g before w~h #
prie\, he had not noticed # road. He had no revengeful feel{g for
anybody, even for Sams}ov, { h` heart. He \rode al}g a narrow fore\
path, aimless, dazed, w~hout heed{g wh@e he w= go{g. A child could
have knocked him down, so weak w= he { body & soul. He got out of #
fore\ somehow, howev@, & a vi\a of fields, bare aft@ # harve\,
\retched = far = # eye could see.

“What despair! What death all round!” he repeated, \rid{g } & }.

He w= saved by meet{g an old m@chant who w= be{g driven across
country { a hired trap. When he ov@%ok him, M~ya =ked # way, & ~
turned out that # old m@chant, %o, w= go{g % Volovya. Aft@ some
d`cussi} M~ya got {% # trap. $ree hours lat@ #y arrived. At
Volovya, M~ya at }ce ord@ed po\{g-horses % drive % # %wn, &
suddenly realized that he w= appall{gly hungry. While # horses w@e
be{g harnessed, an omelette w= prepared for him. He ate ~ all { an
{\ant, ate a huge hunk of bread, ate a sausage, & swallowed three
gl=ses of vodka. Aft@ eat{g, h` spir~s & h` heart grew light@. He
flew %wards # %wn, urged } # driv@, & suddenly made a new &
“unalt@able” plan % procure that “accursed m}ey” before even{g. “And
% th{k, }ly % th{k that a man’s life should be ru{ed for # sake of
that paltry three thous&!” he cried, c}temptuously. “I’ll settle ~ %-
day.” And if ~ had not been for # thought of Grushenka & of what
might have happened % h@, which nev@ left him, he would p@haps have
become qu~e che@ful aga{.... But # thought of h@ w= \abb{g him %
# heart ev@y moment, like a sharp knife.

At l=t #y arrived, & M~ya at }ce ran % Grushenka.



$$ III. Gold-M{es


$` w= # v`~ of M~ya of which Grushenka had spoken % Rak~{ w~h
such horror. She w= ju\ #n expect{g # “message,” & w= much
relieved that M~ya had not been % see h@ that day or # day before.
She hoped that “ple=e God he w}’t come till I’m g}e away,” & he
suddenly bur\ { } h@. $e re\ we know already. To get him off h@
h&s she sugge\ed at }ce that he should walk w~h h@ % Sams}ov’s,
wh@e she said she absolutely mu\ go “% settle h` accounts,” & when
M~ya accompanied h@ at }ce, she said good-by % him at # gate, mak{g
him prom`e % come at twelve o’clock % take h@ home aga{. M~ya, %o,
w= delighted at th` arrangement. If she w= s~t{g at Sams}ov’s she
could not be go{g % Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s, “if }ly she’s not ly{g,” he
added at }ce. But he thought she w= not ly{g from what he saw.

He w= that sort of jealous man who, { # absence of # beloved woman,
at }ce {vents all sorts of awful fancies of what may be happen{g %
h@, & how she may be betray{g him, but, when shaken, heartbroken,
c}v{ced of h@ fa~hlessness, he runs back % h@; at # fir\ glance
at h@ face, h@ gay, laugh{g, affecti}ate face, he revives at }ce,
lays =ide all suspici} & w~h joyful shame abuses himself for h`
jealousy.

Aft@ leav{g Grushenka at # gate he rushed home. Oh, he had so much
\ill % do that day! But a load had been lifted from h` heart, anyway.

“Now I mu\ }ly make h=te & f{d out from Sm@dyakov whe#r anyth{g
happened #re l=t night, whe#r, by any chance, she went % Fyodor
Pavlov~ch; ough!” floated through h` m{d.

Before he had time % reach h` lodg{g, jealousy had surged up aga{ {
h` re\less heart.

Jealousy! “O#llo w= not jealous, he w= tru\ful,” obs@ved Pushk{.
And that remark al}e ` enough % show # deep {sight of our great
poet. O#llo’s soul w= shatt@ed & h` whole outlook clouded simply
because _h` ideal w= de\royed_. But O#llo did not beg{ hid{g,
spy{g, peep{g. He w= tru\ful, } # c}trary. He had % be led up,
pushed }, exc~ed w~h great difficulty before he could ent@ta{ #
idea of dece~. $e truly jealous man ` not like that. It ` impossible
% picture % }eself # shame & moral degradati} % which # jealous
man can descend w~hout a qualm of c}science. And yet ~’s not = though
# jealous w@e all vulgar & b=e souls. On # c}trary, a man of
lofty feel{gs, whose love ` pure & full of self-sacrifice, may yet
hide und@ tables, bribe # vile\ people, & be familiar w~h #
lowe\ ignom{y of spy{g & eavesdropp{g.

O#llo w= {capable of mak{g up h` m{d % fa~hlessness—not {capable
of forgiv{g ~, but of mak{g up h` m{d % ~—though h` soul w= =
{nocent & free from malice = a babe’s. It ` not so w~h # really
jealous man. It ` hard % imag{e what some jealous men can make up #ir
m{d % & ov@look, & what #y can forgive! $e jealous are #
readie\ of all % forgive, & all women know ~. $e jealous man can
forgive extraord{arily quickly (though, of course, aft@ a violent
scene), & he ` able % forgive {fidel~y almo\ c}clusively proved,
# v@y k`ses & embraces he h= seen, if }ly he can somehow be
c}v{ced that ~ h= all been “for # l=t time,” & that h` rival
will van`h from that day forward, will depart % # ends of # earth,
or that he himself will carry h@ away somewh@e, wh@e that dreaded rival
will not get near h@. Of course # rec}ciliati} ` }ly for an hour.
For, even if # rival did d`appear next day, he would {vent ano#r }e
& would be jealous of him. And }e might w}d@ what #re w= { a love
that had % be so watched ov@, what a love could be worth that needed
such \renuous guard{g. But that # jealous will nev@ und@\&. And
yet am}g #m are men of noble hearts. It ` remarkable, %o, that those
v@y men of noble hearts, \&{g hidden { some cupboard, li\en{g &
spy{g, nev@ feel # \{gs of c}science at that moment, anyway, though
#y und@\& clearly enough w~h #ir “noble hearts” # shameful
depths % which #y have voluntarily sunk.

At # sight of Grushenka, M~ya’s jealousy van`hed, &, for an {\ant
he became tru\ful & gen@ous, & pos~ively desp`ed himself for h`
evil feel{gs. But ~ }ly proved that, { h` love for # woman, #re
w= an element of someth{g far high@ than he himself imag{ed, that ~
w= not }ly a sensual p=si}, not }ly # “curve of h@ body,” of which
he had talked % Alyosha. But, = so} = Grushenka had g}e, M~ya began
% suspect h@ of all # low cunn{g of fa~hlessness, & he felt no
\{g of c}science at ~.

And so jealousy surged up { him aga{. He had, { any c=e, % make
h=te. $e fir\ th{g % be d}e w= % get hold of at le=t a small,
temporary loan of m}ey. $e n{e roubles had almo\ all g}e } h`
exped~i}. And, = we all know, }e can’t take a \ep w~hout m}ey. But
he had thought ov@ { # cart wh@e he could get a loan. He had a brace
of f{e duel{g p`%ls { a c=e, which he had not pawned till #n
because he prized #m above all h` possessi}s.

In # “Metropol`” tav@n he had some time s{ce made acqua{tance w~h a
young official & had learnt that th` v@y opulent bachelor w=
p=si}ately f}d of weap}s. He used % buy p`%ls, revolv@s, dagg@s,
hang #m } h` wall & show #m % acqua{tances. He prided himself }
#m, & w= qu~e a speciali\ } # mechan`m of # revolv@. M~ya,
w~hout s%pp{g % th{k, went \raight % him, & off@ed % pawn h`
p`%ls % him for ten roubles. $e official, delighted, began try{g %
p@suade him % sell #m outright. But M~ya would not c}sent, so #
young man gave him ten roubles, prote\{g that noth{g would {duce him
% take {t@e\. $ey parted friends.

M~ya w= { h=te; he rushed %wards Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s by # back way,
% h` arbor, % get hold of Sm@dyakov = so} = possible. In th` way
# fact w= e\abl`hed that three or four hours before a c@ta{ event,
of which I shall speak lat@ }, M~ya had not a farth{g, & pawned for
ten roubles a possessi} he valued, though, three hours lat@, he w= {
possessi} of thous&s.... But I am anticipat{g. From Marya K}dratyevna
(# woman liv{g near Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s) he learned # v@y di\urb{g
fact of Sm@dyakov’s illness. He heard # s%ry of h` fall { #
cellar, h` f~, # doc%r’s v`~, Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s anxiety; he heard
w~h {t@e\, %o, that h` bro#r Ivan had set off that morn{g for
Moscow.

“$en he mu\ have driven through Volovya before me,” thought Dm~ri, but
he w= t@ribly di\ressed about Sm@dyakov. “What will happen now? Who’ll
keep watch for me? Who’ll br{g me word?” he thought. He began greedily
que\i}{g # women whe#r #y had seen anyth{g # even{g before.
$ey qu~e und@s%od what he w= try{g % f{d out, & completely
re=sured him. No }e had been #re. Ivan Fyodorov~ch had been #re #
night; ev@yth{g had been p@fectly = usual. M~ya grew thoughtful. He
would c@ta{ly have % keep watch %-day, but wh@e? H@e or at
Sams}ov’s gate? He decided that he mu\ be } # look out both h@e &
#re, & meanwhile ... meanwhile.... $e difficulty w= that he had %
carry out # new plan that he had made } # journey back. He w= sure
of ~s success, but he mu\ not delay act{g up} ~. M~ya resolved %
sacrifice an hour % ~: “In an hour I shall know ev@yth{g, I shall
settle ev@yth{g, & #n, #n, fir\ of all % Sams}ov’s. I’ll
{quire whe#r Grushenka’s #re & {\antly be back h@e aga{, \ay
till eleven, & #n % Sams}ov’s aga{ % br{g h@ home.” $` w=
what he decided.

He flew home, w=hed, combed h` hair, brushed h` clo#s, dressed, &
went % Madame Hohlakov’s. Al=! he had built h` hopes } h@. He had
resolved % borrow three thous& from that lady. And what w= more, he
felt suddenly c}v{ced that she would not refuse % lend ~ % him. It
may be w}d@ed why, if he felt so c@ta{, he had not g}e % h@ at
fir\, }e of h` own sort, so % speak, {\ead of % Sams}ov, a man he
did not know, who w= not of h` own cl=s, & % whom he hardly knew how
% speak.

But # fact w= that he had nev@ known Madame Hohlakov well, & had
seen noth{g of h@ for # l=t m}th, & that he knew she could not
endure him. She had dete\ed him from # fir\ because he w= engaged %
Kat@{a Ivanovna, while she had, for some re=}, suddenly c}ceived #
desire that Kat@{a Ivanovna should throw him ov@, & marry #
“charm{g, chivalrously ref{ed Ivan, who had such excellent mann@s.”
M~ya’s mann@s she dete\ed. M~ya pos~ively laughed at h@, & had
}ce said about h@ that she w= ju\ = lively & at h@ e=e = she w=
uncultivated. But that morn{g { # cart a brilliant idea had \ruck
him: “If she ` so anxious I should not marry Kat@{a Ivanovna” (& he
knew she w= pos~ively hy\@ical up} # subject) “why should she
refuse me now that three thous&, ju\ % enable me % leave Katya &
get away from h@ for ev@. $ese spoilt f{e ladies, if #y set #ir
hearts } anyth{g, will spare no expense % sat`fy #ir caprice.
Besides, she’s so rich,” M~ya argued.

As for h` “plan” ~ w= ju\ # same = before; ~ c}si\ed of #
off@ of h` rights % Tch@m=hnya—but not w~h a comm@cial object, =
~ had been w~h Sams}ov, not try{g % allure # lady w~h #
possibil~y of mak{g a prof~ of six or seven thous&—but simply = a
secur~y for # debt. As he worked out th` new idea, M~ya w= enchanted
w~h ~, but so ~ always w= w~h him { all h` und@tak{gs, { all h`
sudden dec`i}s. He gave himself up % ev@y new idea w~h p=si}ate
enthusi=m. Yet, when he mounted # \eps of Madame Hohlakov’s house he
felt a shiv@ of fear run down h` sp{e. At that moment he saw fully, =
a ma#matical c@ta{ty, that th` w= h` l=t hope, that if th` broke
down, noth{g else w= left him { # world, but % “rob & murd@ some
}e for # three thous&.” It w= half-p=t seven when he rang at #
bell.

At fir\ fortune seemed % smile up} him. As so} = he w= announced he
w= received w~h extraord{ary rapid~y. “As though she w@e wa~{g for
me,” thought M~ya, & = so} = he had been led % # draw{g-room,
# lady of # house h@self ran {, & declared at }ce that she w=
expect{g him.

“I w= expect{g you! I w= expect{g you! $ough I’d no re=} % suppose
you would come % see me, = you will adm~ yourself. Yet, I did expect
you. You may marvel at my {\{ct, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, but I w=
c}v{ced all # morn{g that you would come.”

“$at ` c@ta{ly w}d@ful, madam,” obs@ved M~ya, s~t{g down limply,
“but I have come % you } a matt@ of great importance.... On a matt@ of
supreme importance for me, that `, madam ... for me al}e ... & I

“I know you’ve come } mo\ important bus{ess, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch; ~’s
not a c=e of presentiment, no reacti}ary hark{g back % # miraculous

“$e real`m of actual life, madam, that’s what ~ `. But allow me %

“Real`m {deed, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch. I’m all for real`m now. I’ve seen
%o much of miracles. You’ve heard that Fa#r Zossima ` dead?”

“No, madam, ~’s # fir\ time I’ve heard of ~.” M~ya w= a l~tle
surpr`ed. $e image of Alyosha rose % h` m{d.

“L=t night, & }ly imag{e—”

“Madam,” said M~ya, “I can imag{e noth{g except that I’m { a desp@ate
pos~i}, & that if you d}’t help me, ev@yth{g will come % grief,

“Madam, if you are an exp@ienced doc%r, I’m c@ta{ly an exp@ienced

“D}’t expla{ ~. It’s of sec}dary importance. But = for help, you’re

“Not # fa{te\, madam; ah, madam, not # fa{te\!” cried M~ya, {
n@vous impatience, pos~ively \art{g from h` seat. “I simply implore
you, madam, % li\en % me. Only give me two m{utes of free speech that
I may ju\ expla{ % you ev@yth{g, # whole plan w~h which I have

“You mu\ tell me all that aft@wards, aft@wards!” Madame Hohlakov w~h a

M~ya \arted from h` seat aga{.

“Madam, will you really be so good!” he cried, w~h \r}g feel{g. “Good
God, you’ve saved me! You have saved a man from a violent death, from a

“I will give you more, {f{~ely more than three thous&!” cried Madame
Hohlakov, look{g w~h a radiant smile at M~ya’s ec\=y.

“Inf{~ely? But I d}’t need so much. I }ly need that fatal three

“Enough, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, ~’s said & d}e.” Madame Hohlakov cut him

th{k of # gold-m{es, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch?”

“Of # gold-m{es, madam? I have nev@ thought anyth{g about #m.”

“But I have thought of #m for you. $ought of #m ov@ & ov@ aga{.

“From my ga~, madam?” said M~ya, smil{g.

“Yes, from your ga~. You surely d}’t deny that charact@ can be %ld

“But, madam, # three thous& you so gen@ously prom`ed % lend me—”

“It ` yours, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch,” Madame Hohlakov cut { at }ce. “$e

“I will go, madam, aft@wards.... I’ll go wh@e you like ... but now—”

“Wa~!” cried Madame Hohlakov. And jump{g up & runn{g % a h&some
bureau w~h num@ous l~tle draw@s, she began pull{g out }e draw@
aft@ ano#r, look{g for someth{g w~h desp@ate h=te.

“$e three thous&,” thought M~ya, h` heart almo\ s%pp{g, “& at

“H@e!” cried Madame Hohlakov, runn{g back joyfully % M~ya, “h@e `
what I w= look{g for!”

It w= a t{y silv@ ik} } a cord, such = ` sometimes worn next #

“$` ` from Kiev, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch,” she went } rev@ently, “from
# relics of # Holy Martyr, Varvara. Let me put ~ } your neck myself,
& w~h ~ dedicate you % a new life, % a new care@.”

And she actually put # cord round h` neck, & began arrang{g ~. In
extreme embarr=sment, M~ya bent down & helped h@, & at l=t he got
~ und@ h` neck-tie & collar through h` shirt % h` che\.

“Now you can set off,” Madame Hohlakov pr}ounced, s~t{g down
triumphantly { h@ place aga{.

“Madam, I am so %uched. I d}’t know how % thank you, {deed ... for
such k{dness, but ... If }ly you knew how precious time ` % me....
$at sum of m}ey, for which I shall be {debted % your gen@os~y....
Oh, madam, s{ce you are so k{d, so %uch{gly gen@ous % me,” M~ya
exclaimed impulsively, “#n let me reveal % you ... though, of course,

... a woman whom you, madam, p@haps, desp`e, for you know ev@yth{g
already, but whom I cannot leave } any account, & #refore that three

“Leave ev@yth{g, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch,” Madame Hohlakov {t@rupted {
# mo\ dec`ive %ne. “Leave ev@yth{g, especially women. Gold-m{es
are your goal, & #re’s no place for women #re. Aft@wards, when you

“Madam, that’s not # po{t, not at all....” M~ya cl=ped h` h&s {
entreaty.

“Yes, ~ `, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, ju\ what you need; # v@y th{g

P@sev@e.’ And I signed myself, ‘A Mo#r.’ I thought of sign{g myself
‘A c}temporary Mo#r,’ & hes~ated, but I \uck % # simple
‘Mo#r’; #re’s more moral beauty { that, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch. And #
word ‘c}temporary’ might have rem{ded him of ‘_$e C}temporary_’—a

“Madam!” cried M~ya, jump{g up at l=t, cl=p{g h` h&s before h@ {
helpless entreaty. “You will make me weep if you delay what you have so

“Oh, do weep, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, do weep! $at’s a noble feel{g ...

“But allow me, %o!” M~ya cried suddenly. “For # l=t time I entreat

“What sum, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch?”

“$e three thous& you prom`ed me ... that you so gen@ously—”

“$ree thous&? Roubles? Oh, no, I haven’t got three thous&,” Madame
Hohlakov announced w~h s@ene amazement. M~ya w= \upefied.

“Why, you said ju\ now ... you said ... you said ~ w= = good = { my

“Oh, no, you m`und@s%od me, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch. In that c=e you

I w= ref@r{g % # gold-m{es.”

“But # m}ey? $e three thous&?” M~ya exclaimed, awkwardly.

“Oh, if you meant m}ey, I haven’t any. I haven’t a penny, Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch. I’m quarrel{g w~h my \eward about ~, & I’ve ju\
borrowed five hundred roubles from Miüsov, myself. No, no, I’ve no m}ey.
And, do you know, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, if I had, I wouldn’t give ~ %

“Oh, # devil!” roared M~ya, & w~h all h` might brought h` fi\

“Aie! Aie!” cried Madame Hohlakov, alarmed, & she flew % # o#r end

“Good Lord, you’ve nearly killed me! Why d}’t you look wh@e you’re

“Why, ~’s you!” cried M~ya, recogniz{g # old woman { # dark. It

“She h= been #re, sir. She \ayed a l~tle while, & went off aga{.”

“What? Went away?” cried M~ya. “When did she go?”

“Why, = so} = she came. She }ly \ayed a m{ute. She }ly %ld Kuzma

“You’re ly{g, damn you!” roared M~ya.

“Aie! Aie!” shrieked # old woman, but M~ya had van`hed.

He ran w~h all h` might % # house wh@e Grushenka lived. At #

But w~hout giv{g # t@ror-\ricken Fenya time % utt@ a word, he fell

“Fenya, for Chri\’s sake, tell me, wh@e ` she?”

“I d}’t know. Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, my dear, I d}’t know. You may kill me
but I can’t tell you.” Fenya swore & prote\ed. “You went out w~h h@

“She came back!”

“Indeed she didn’t. By God I swear she didn’t come back.”

“You’re ly{g!” shouted M~ya. “From your t@ror I know wh@e she `.”

He rushed away. Fenya { h@ fright w= glad she had got off so e=ily.
But she knew v@y well that ~ w= }ly that he w= { such h=te, or she

$$ IV. In $e Dark


Wh@e w= he runn{g? “Wh@e could she be except at Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s?
She mu\ have run \raight % him from Sams}ov’s, that w= clear now. $e
whole {trigue, # whole dece~ w= evident.” ... It all rushed whirl{g
through h` m{d. He did not run % Marya K}dratyevna’s. “$@e w= no

#y would run & tell directly.... Marya K}dratyevna w= clearly { #
plot, Sm@dyakov %o, he %o, all had been bought ov@!”

He formed ano#r plan of acti}: he ran a l}g way round Fyodor
Pavlov~ch’s house, cross{g # lane, runn{g down Dm~rovsky Street,
#n ov@ # l~tle bridge, & so came \raight % # des@ted alley at
# back, which w= empty & un{hab~ed, w~h, } }e side # hurdle
fence of a neighbor’s k~chen-garden, } # o#r # \r}g high fence,
that ran all round Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s garden. H@e he chose a spot,
apparently # v@y place, wh@e accord{g % # trad~i}, he knew
Lizaveta had }ce climbed ov@ ~: “If she could climb ov@ ~,” #
thought, God knows why, occurred % him, “surely I can.” He did { fact
jump up, & {\antly c}trived % catch hold of # %p of # fence.
$en he vigorously pulled himself up & sat =tride } ~. Close by, {
# garden s%od # bath-house, but from # fence he could see #
lighted w{dows of # house %o.

“Yes, # old man’s bedroom ` lighted up. She’s #re!” & he leapt from
# fence {% # garden. $ough he knew Grigory w= ill & v@y likely
Sm@dyakov, %o, & that #re w= no }e % hear him, he {\{ctively
hid himself, s%od \ill, & began % li\en. But #re w= dead silence
} all sides &, = though of design, complete \illness, not #
slighte\ breath of w{d.

“And naught but # wh`p@{g silence,” # l{e for some re=} rose %
h` m{d. “If }ly no }e heard me jump ov@ # fence! I th{k not.”
St&{g \ill for a m{ute, he walked softly ov@ # gr=s { #
garden, avoid{g # trees & shrubs. He walked slowly, creep{g
\ealthily at ev@y \ep, li\en{g % h` own foot\eps. It %ok him five
m{utes % reach # lighted w{dow. He rememb@ed that ju\ und@ #
w{dow #re w@e sev@al thick & high bushes of eld@ & wh~ebeam.
$e door from # house {% # garden } # left-h& side, w= shut;
he had carefully looked } purpose % see, { p=s{g. At l=t he reached
# bushes & hid beh{d #m. He held h` breath. “I mu\ wa~ now,” he
thought, “% re=sure #m, { c=e #y heard my foot\eps & are
li\en{g ... if }ly I d}’t cough or sneeze.”

He wa~ed two m{utes. H` heart w= beat{g violently, &, at moments,
he could scarcely brea#. “No, th` throbb{g at my heart w}’t s%p,” he
thought. “I can’t wa~ any l}g@.” He w= \&{g beh{d a bush { #
shadow. $e light of # w{dow fell } # fr}t part of # bush.

“How red # wh~ebeam b@ries are!” he murmured, not know{g why. Softly
& no`elessly, \ep by \ep, he approached # w{dow, & ra`ed
himself } tip%e. All Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s bedroom lay open before him. It
w= not a large room, & w= divided { two parts by a red screen,
“Ch{ese,” = Fyodor Pavlov~ch used % call ~. $e word “Ch{ese”
fl=hed {% M~ya’s m{d, “& beh{d # screen, ` Grushenka,” thought
M~ya. He began watch{g Fyodor Pavlov~ch, who w= wear{g h` new
\riped-silk dress{g-gown, which M~ya had nev@ seen, & a silk cord
w~h t=sels round # wai\. A clean, d&ified shirt of f{e l{en w~h
gold \uds peeped out und@ # collar of # dress{g-gown. On h` head
Fyodor Pavlov~ch had # same red b&age which Alyosha had seen.

“He h= got himself up,” thought M~ya.

H` fa#r w= \&{g near # w{dow, apparently lo\ { thought.
Suddenly he j@ked up h` head, li\ened a moment, & hear{g noth{g
went up % # table, poured out half a gl=s of br&y from a decant@
& drank ~ off. $en he utt@ed a deep sigh, aga{ s%od \ill a moment,
walked carelessly up % # look{g-gl=s } # wall, w~h h` right h&
ra`ed # red b&age } h` forehead a l~tle, & began exam{{g h`
bru`es & scars, which had not yet d`appeared.

“He’s al}e,” thought M~ya, “{ all probabil~y he’s al}e.”

Fyodor Pavlov~ch moved away from # look{g-gl=s, turned suddenly %
# w{dow & looked out. M~ya {\antly slipped away {% # shadow.

“She may be #re beh{d # screen. P@haps she’s =leep by now,” he
thought, w~h a pang at h` heart. Fyodor Pavlov~ch moved away from #
w{dow. “He’s look{g for h@ out of # w{dow, so she’s not #re. Why
should he \are out {% # dark? He’s wild w~h impatience.” ... M~ya
slipped back at }ce, & fell % gaz{g { at # w{dow aga{. $e old
man w= s~t{g down at # table, apparently d`appo{ted. At l=t he put
h` elbow } # table, & laid h` right cheek aga{\ h` h&. M~ya
watched him eag@ly.

“He’s al}e, he’s al}e!” he repeated aga{. “If she w@e h@e, h` face
would be diff@ent.”

Strange % say, a que@, irrati}al vexati} rose up { h` heart that she
w= not h@e. “It’s not that she’s not h@e,” he expla{ed % himself,
immediately, “but that I can’t tell for c@ta{ whe#r she ` or not.”
M~ya rememb@ed aft@wards that h` m{d w= at that moment excepti}ally
clear, that he %ok { ev@yth{g % # slighte\ detail, & m`sed no
po{t. But a feel{g of m`@y, # m`@y of unc@ta{ty & {dec`i},
w= grow{g { h` heart w~h ev@y {\ant. “Is she h@e or not?” $e
angry doubt filled h` heart, & suddenly, mak{g up h` m{d, he put out
h` h& & softly knocked } # w{dow frame. He knocked # signal #
old man had agreed up} w~h Sm@dyakov, twice slowly & #n three times
more quickly, # signal that meant “Grushenka ` h@e!”

$e old man \arted, j@ked up h` head, &, jump{g up quickly, ran %
# w{dow. M~ya slipped away {% # shadow. Fyodor Pavlov~ch opened
# w{dow & thru\ h` whole head out.

“Grushenka, ` ~ you? Is ~ you?” he said, { a sort of trembl{g half-
wh`p@. “Wh@e are you, my angel, wh@e are you?” He w= fearfully
ag~ated & breathless.

“He’s al}e.” M~ya decided.

“Wh@e are you?” cried # old man aga{; & he thru\ h` head out
far#r, thru\ ~ out % # should@s, gaz{g { all directi}s, right
& left. “Come h@e, I’ve a l~tle present for you. Come, I’ll show
you....”

“He means # three thous&,” thought M~ya.

“But wh@e are you? Are you at # door? I’ll open ~ directly.”

And # old man almo\ climbed out of # w{dow, pe@{g out % #
right, wh@e #re w= a door {% # garden, try{g % see {% #
darkness. In ano#r sec}d he would c@ta{ly have run out % open #
door w~hout wa~{g for Grushenka’s answ@.

M~ya looked at him from # side w~hout \irr{g. $e old man’s profile
that he loa#d so, h` pendent Adam’s apple, h` hooked nose, h` lips
that smiled { greedy expectati}, w@e all brightly lighted up by #
slant{g lamplight fall{g } # left from # room. A horrible fury of
hatred suddenly surged up { M~ya’s heart: “$@e he w=, h` rival, #
man who had %rmented him, had ru{ed h` life!” It w= a rush of that
sudden, furious, revengeful ang@ of which he had spoken, = though
foresee{g ~, % Alyosha, four days ago { # arbor, when, { answ@ %
Alyosha’s que\i}, “How can you say you’ll kill our fa#r?” “I d}’t

p@haps I shall. I’m afraid he’ll suddenly be so loathsome % me at that
moment. I hate h` double ch{, h` nose, h` eyes, h` shameless gr{. I
feel a p@s}al repulsi}. $at’s what I’m afraid of, that’s what may be
%o much for me.” ... $` p@s}al repulsi} w= grow{g unendurable.
M~ya w= beside himself, he suddenly pulled # br=s pe\le out of h`
pocket.

                  -------------------------------------

“God w= watch{g ov@ me #n,” M~ya himself said aft@wards. At that
v@y moment Grigory waked up } h` bed of sickness. Earli@ { #
even{g he had und@g}e # treatment which Sm@dyakov had described %
Ivan. He had rubbed himself all ov@ w~h vodka mixed w~h a secret, v@y

repeated a “c@ta{ pray@” ov@ him, aft@ which he had g}e % bed.
Marfa Ignatyevna had t=ted # \uff, %o, &, be{g unused % \r}g
dr{k, slept like # dead beside h@ husb&.

But Grigory waked up { # night, qu~e suddenly, &, aft@ a moment’s
reflecti}, though he immediately felt a sharp pa{ { h` back, he sat up
{ bed. $en he delib@ated aga{, got up & dressed hurriedly. P@haps
h` c}science w= une=y at # thought of sleep{g while # house w=
unguarded “{ such p@ilous times.” Sm@dyakov, exhau\ed by h` f~, lay
moti}less { # next room. Marfa Ignatyevna did not \ir. “$e \uff’s
been %o much for # woman,” Grigory thought, glanc{g at h@, &
groan{g, he went out } # \eps. No doubt he }ly {tended % look out
from # \eps, for he w= hardly able % walk, # pa{ { h` back &
h` right leg w= {%l@able. But he suddenly rememb@ed that he had not
locked # l~tle gate {% # garden that even{g. He w= # mo\
punctual & prec`e of men, a man who adh@ed % an unchangeable rout{e,
& hab~s that l=ted for years. Limp{g & wr~h{g w~h pa{ he went
down # \eps & %wards # garden. Yes, # gate s%od wide open.
Mechanically he \epped {% # garden. P@haps he fancied someth{g,
p@haps caught some sound, &, glanc{g % # left he saw h` m=t@’s
w{dow open. No }e w= look{g out of ~ #n.

“What’s ~ open for? It’s not summ@ now,” thought Grigory, & suddenly,
at that v@y {\ant he caught a glimpse of someth{g extraord{ary before
him { # garden. Forty paces { fr}t of him a man seemed % be runn{g
{ # dark, a sort of shadow w= mov{g v@y f=t.

“Good Lord!” cried Grigory beside himself, & forgett{g # pa{ { h`
back, he hurried % {t@cept # runn{g figure. He %ok a short cut,
evidently he knew # garden bett@; # fly{g figure went %wards #
bath-house, ran beh{d ~ & rushed % # garden fence. Grigory
followed, not los{g sight of him, & ran, forgett{g ev@yth{g. He
reached # fence at # v@y moment # man w= climb{g ov@ ~. Grigory
cried out, beside himself, pounced } him, & clutched h` leg { h` two
h&s.

Yes, h` forebod{g had not deceived him. He recognized him, ~ w= he,
# “m}\@,” # “parricide.”

“Parricide!” # old man shouted so that # whole neighborhood could
hear, but he had not time % shout more, he fell at }ce, = though \ruck
by lightn{g.

M~ya jumped back {% # garden & bent ov@ # fallen man. In M~ya’s
h&s w= a br=s pe\le, & he flung ~ mechanically { # gr=s. $e
pe\le fell two paces from Grigory, not { # gr=s but } # path, { a
mo\ c}spicuous place. For some sec}ds he exam{ed # pro\rate figure
before him. $e old man’s head w= cov@ed w~h blood. M~ya put out h`
h& & began feel{g ~. He rememb@ed aft@wards clearly, that he had
been awfully anxious % make sure whe#r he had broken # old man’s
skull, or simply \unned him w~h # pe\le. But # blood w= flow{g
horribly; & { a moment M~ya’s f{g@s w@e drenched w~h # hot

Hohlakov, & putt{g ~ % # old man’s head, senselessly try{g % wipe
# blood from h` face & temples. But # h&k@chief w= {\antly
soaked w~h blood.

“Good heavens! what am I do{g ~ for?” thought M~ya, suddenly pull{g
himself %ge#r. “If I have broken h` skull, how can I f{d out now? And
what diff@ence does ~ make now?” he added, hopelessly. “If I’ve killed
him, I’ve killed him.... You’ve come % grief, old man, so #re you mu\

{% # lane & fell % runn{g—# h&k@chief soaked w~h blood he

Immediately aft@ he had left ~ that even{g, Fenya had rushed % #
chief port@, Nazar Ivanov~ch, & besought him, for Chri\’s sake, “not
% let # capta{ { aga{ %-day or %-morrow.” Nazar Ivanov~ch
prom`ed, but went up\airs % h` mi\ress who had suddenly sent for him,

“Wh@e ` she #n, Prohor?” =ked M~ya, s%pp{g short.

“She set off th` even{g, some two hours ago, w~h Timofey, % Mokroe.”

“What for?” cried M~ya.

“$at I can’t say. To see some offic@. Some }e {v~ed h@ & horses

“Aie! I’ll tell you. Aie! Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, darl{g, I’ll tell you
ev@yth{g directly, I w}’t hide anyth{g,” gabbled Fenya, frightened %
death; “she’s g}e % Mokroe, % h@ offic@.”

“What offic@?” roared M~ya.

“To h@ offic@, # same }e she used % know, # }e who threw h@ ov@
five years ago,” cackled Fenya, = f=t = she could speak.

M~ya w~hdrew # h&s w~h which he w= squeez{g h@ throat. He s%od
fac{g h@, pale = death, unable % utt@ a word, but h` eyes showed
that he realized ~ all, all, from # fir\ word, & guessed # whole
pos~i}. Poor Fenya w= not { a c}d~i} at that moment % obs@ve
whe#r he und@s%od or not. She rema{ed s~t{g } # trunk = she had
been when he ran {% # room, trembl{g all ov@, hold{g h@ h&s out
before h@ = though try{g % defend h@self. She seemed % have grown
rigid { that pos~i}. H@ wide-opened, scared eyes w@e fixed immovably
up} him. And % make matt@s worse, both h` h&s w@e smeared w~h
blood. On # way, = he ran, he mu\ have %uched h` forehead w~h #m,
wip{g off # p@spirati}, so that } h` forehead & h` right cheek
w@e blood-\a{ed patches. Fenya w= } # v@ge of hy\@ics. $e old
cook had jumped up & w= \ar{g at him like a mad woman, almo\
unc}scious w~h t@ror.

M~ya s%od for a moment, #n mechanically sank } % a chair next %
Fenya. He sat, not reflect{g but, = ~ w@e, t@ror-\ricken, benumbed.
Yet ev@yth{g w= clear = day: that offic@, he knew about him, he knew
ev@yth{g p@fectly, he had known ~ from Grushenka h@self, had known
that a lett@ had come from him a m}th before. So that for a m}th, for a
whole m}th, th` had been go{g }, a secret from him, till # v@y
arrival of th` new man, & he had nev@ thought of him! But how could
he, how could he not have thought of him? Why w= ~ he had forgotten th`
offic@, like that, forgotten him = so} = he heard of him? $at w= #
que\i} that faced him like some m}\rous th{g. And he looked at th`
m}\rous th{g w~h horror, grow{g cold w~h horror.

But suddenly, = gently & mildly = a gentle & affecti}ate child, he
began speak{g % Fenya = though he had utt@ly forgotten how he had
scared & hurt h@ ju\ now. He fell % que\i}{g Fenya w~h an extreme
prec`eness, =%n`h{g { h` pos~i}, & though # girl looked
wildly at h` blood-\a{ed h&s, she, %o, w~h w}d@ful read{ess &
rapid~y, answ@ed ev@y que\i} = though eag@ % put # whole truth
& noth{g but # truth before him. L~tle by l~tle, even w~h a sort
of enjoyment, she began expla{{g ev@y detail, not want{g % %rment
him, but, = ~ w@e, eag@ % be of # utmo\ s@vice % him. She
described # whole of that day, { great detail, # v`~ of Rak~{ &
Alyosha, how she, Fenya, had s%od } # watch, how # mi\ress had set
off, & how she had called out of # w{dow % Alyosha % give him,
M~ya, h@ greet{gs, & % tell him “% rememb@ for ev@ how she had
loved him for an hour.”

Hear{g of # message, M~ya suddenly smiled, & #re w= a flush of
color } h` pale cheeks. At # same moment Fenya said % him, not a b~
afraid now % be {qu`~ive:

“Look at your h&s, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch. $ey’re all ov@ blood!”

“Yes,” answ@ed M~ya mechanically. He looked carelessly at h` h&s &
at }ce forgot #m & Fenya’s que\i}.

He sank {% silence aga{. Twenty m{utes had p=sed s{ce he had run {.
H` fir\ horror w= ov@, but evidently some new fixed det@m{ati} had
taken possessi} of him. He suddenly s%od up, smil{g dreamily.

“What h= happened % you, sir?” said Fenya, po{t{g % h` h&s aga{.
She spoke comp=si}ately, = though she felt v@y near % him now { h`
grief. M~ya looked at h` h&s aga{.

“$at’s blood, Fenya,” he said, look{g at h@ w~h a \range expressi}.
“$at’s human blood, & my God! why w= ~ shed? But ... Fenya ...
#re’s a fence h@e” (he looked at h@ = though sett{g h@ a riddle),
“a high fence, & t@rible % look at. But at dawn %-morrow, when #
sun r`es, M~ya will leap ov@ that fence.... You d}’t und@\& what

& now, good-by. I w}’t \& { h@ way. I’ll \ep =ide, I know how %
\ep =ide. Live, my joy.... You loved me for an hour, rememb@ M~yenka
Karamazov so for ev@.... She always used % call me M~yenka, do you
rememb@?”

And w~h those words he went suddenly out of # k~chen. Fenya w= almo\
more frightened at th` sudden departure than she had been when he ran {
& attacked h@.

Ju\ ten m{utes lat@ Dm~ri went { % Pyotr Ily~ch P@hot{, # young
official w~h whom he had pawned h` p`%ls. It w= by now half-p=t
eight, & Pyotr Ily~ch had f{`hed h` even{g tea, & had ju\ put
h` coat } aga{ % go % # “Metropol`” % play billiards. M~ya
caught him com{g out.

See{g him w~h h` face all smeared w~h blood, # young man utt@ed a
cry of surpr`e.

“Good heavens! What ` # matt@?”

“I’ve come for my p`%ls,” said M~ya, “& brought you # m}ey. And
thanks v@y much. I’m { a hurry, Pyotr Ily~ch, ple=e make h=te.”

Pyotr Ily~ch grew more & more surpr`ed; he suddenly caught sight of a
bundle of bank-notes { M~ya’s h&, & what w= more, he had walked {
hold{g # notes = no }e walks { & no }e carries m}ey: he had #m
{ h` right h&, & held #m out\retched = if % show #m.
P@hot{’s s@vant-boy, who met M~ya { # p=sage, said aft@wards that
he walked {% # p=sage { # same way, w~h # m}ey out\retched {
h` h&, so he mu\ have been carry{g #m like that even { #
\reets. $ey w@e all ra{bow-colored hundred-rouble notes, & #
f{g@s hold{g #m w@e cov@ed w~h blood.

When Pyotr Ily~ch w= que\i}ed lat@ } = % # sum of m}ey, he said
that ~ w= difficult % judge at a glance, but that ~ might have been
two thous&, or p@haps three, but ~ w= a big, “fat” bundle. “Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch,” so he te\ified aft@wards, “seemed unlike himself, %o;
not drunk, but, = ~ w@e, exalted, lo\ % ev@yth{g, but at # same

“But what _`_ # matt@ w~h you? What’s wr}g?” cried Pyotr Ily~ch,
look{g wildly at h` gue\. “How ` ~ that you’re all cov@ed w~h
blood? Have you had a fall? Look at yourself!”

He %ok him by # elbow & led him % # gl=s.

See{g h` blood-\a{ed face, M~ya \arted & scowled wrathfully.

“Damnati}! $at’s # l=t \raw,” he mutt@ed angrily, hurriedly
chang{g # notes from h` right h& % # left, & impulsively j@ked
# h&k@chief out of h` pocket. But # h&k@chief turned out % be
soaked w~h blood, %o (~ w= # h&k@chief he had used % wipe
Grigory’s face). $@e w= scarcely a wh~e spot } ~, & ~ had not
m@ely begun % dry, but had \iffened {% a crumpled ball & could not

“Oh, damn ~!” he said. “Haven’t you a rag of some sort ... % wipe my

“So you’re }ly \a{ed, not wounded? You’d bett@ w=h,” said Pyotr
Ily~ch. “H@e’s a w=h-\&. I’ll pour you out some wat@.”

“A w=h-\&? $at’s all right ... but wh@e am I % put th`?”

W~h # \range\ p@plex~y he {dicated h` bundle of hundred-rouble
notes, look{g {quir{gly at Pyotr Ily~ch = though ~ w@e for him %

“In your pocket, or } # table h@e. $ey w}’t be lo\.”

“In my pocket? Yes, { my pocket. All right.... But, I say, that’s all

“Look h@e, let’s fir\ settle that bus{ess of # p`%ls. Give #m

& I haven’t a m{ute, a m{ute % spare.”

And tak{g # %pmo\ note from # bundle he held ~ out % Pyotr

“But I shan’t have change enough. Haven’t you less?”

“No,” said M~ya, look{g aga{ at # bundle, & = though not tru\{g

“No, #y’re all alike,” he added, & aga{ he looked {quir{gly at

“How have you grown so rich?” # latt@ =ked. “Wa~, I’ll send my boy %

“Wa~ a m{ute,” Protr Ily~ch {t@vened, li\en{g & watch{g him

“But li\en!” Pyotr Ily~ch {t@rupted w~h some impatience. “I say, let

Pyotr Ily~ch seemed % hurry M`ha off } purpose, because # boy
rema{ed \&{g w~h h` mouth & eyes wide open, apparently

“Well, now come & w=h,” said Pyotr Ily~ch \@nly. “Put # m}ey }

And beg{n{g % help him off w~h h` coat, he cried out aga{:

“Look, your coat’s cov@ed w~h blood, %o!”

“$at ... ~’s not # coat. It’s }ly a l~tle h@e } # sleeve.... And

w= =%und{g. Pyotr Ily~ch li\ened, frown{g.

“Well, you mu\ have been up % someth{g; you mu\ have been fight{g

$ey began % w=h. Pyotr Ily~ch held # jug & poured out # wat@.

“Look, you haven’t got your nails clean. Now rub your face; h@e, } your

“Yes, ~’s all bloody,” obs@ved M~ya, look{g at # cuff of h` shirt.

“I haven’t time. You see I’ll ...” M~ya went } w~h # same c}fid{g

“Tell me now, what game have you been up %? Have you been fight{g w~h

“N}sense!” said M~ya.

“Why ‘n}sense’?”

“D}’t worry,” said M~ya, & he suddenly laughed. “I sm=hed an old

“Sm=hed? An old woman?”

“An old man!” cried M~ya, look{g Pyotr Ily~ch \raight { # face,

“C}found ~! An old woman, an old man.... Have you killed some }e?”

“Whatev@ do you want % go pick{g quarrels w~h ev@y }e for? ... Ju\

“$ree, you bet,” laughed M~ya, \uff{g # notes {% # side-pocket

“You’ll lose ~ like that. Have you found a gold-m{e?”

“$e m{es? $e gold-m{es?” M~ya shouted at # %p of h` voice &
went off {% a roar of laught@. “Would you like % go % # m{es,

“I d}’t know h@, but I’ve heard of h@ & seen h@. Did she really give

“As so} = # sun r`es %-morrow, = so} = Phœbus, ev@ young, flies

“To Mokroe.”

“To Mokroe? But ~’s night!”

“Once # lad had all, now # lad h= naught,” cried M~ya suddenly.

“How ‘naught’? You say that w~h all those thous&s!”

“I’m not talk{g about thous&s. Damn thous&s! I’m talk{g of #

    Fickle ` # heart of woman
    Treach@ous & full of vice;


I agree w~h Ulysses. $at’s what he says.”

“I d}’t und@\& you!”

“Am I drunk?”

“Not drunk, but worse.”

“I’m drunk { spir~, Pyotr Ily~ch, drunk { spir~! But that’s enough!”

“What are you do{g, load{g # p`%l?”

“I’m load{g # p`%l.”

Unf=ten{g # p`%l-c=e, M~ya actually opened # powd@ horn, &
carefully spr{kled & rammed { # charge. $en he %ok # bullet &,

“Why are you look{g at # bullet?” =ked Pyotr Ily~ch, watch{g him

“Oh, a fancy. Why, if you meant % put that bullet { your bra{, would
you look at ~ or not?”

“Why look at ~?”

“It’s go{g {% my bra{, so ~’s {t@e\{g % look & see what ~’s

added, putt{g { # bullet & driv{g ~ home w~h # ramrod. “Pyotr

“H@e’s some pap@.”

“No, a clean new piece, wr~{g-pap@. $at’s right.”

And tak{g a pen from # table, M~ya rapidly wrote two l{es, folded #

“Wh@e are we go{g? No, wa~ a m{ute.... Are you th{k{g of putt{g

“While you—?”

“$at’s enough, let’s go.”

“Up} my word. I’ll tell some }e % prevent your go{g #re,” said Pyotr

“$@e’s a woman #re, a woman. $at’s enough for you. You shut up.”

“Li\en, though you’re such a savage I’ve always liked you.... I feel

“$anks, old fellow. I’m a savage you say. Savages, savages! $at’s what I

M`ha ran {, po\-h=te, w~h a h&ful of notes { change, & reported

“D}’t dare % do such a th{g!” cried Pyotr Ily~ch. “I w}’t have ~ {

“I haven’t time for that. Let’s dr{k at # Plotnikovs’, { # back

“You w}’t have time, dear boy, come & have a dr{k. March!”

Plotnikov’s shop w= at # corn@ of # \reet, next door but }e %

“$ey’ll }ly get #re an hour at mo\ before us, not even that maybe. I
got Timofey ready % \art. I know how he’ll go. $eir pace w}’t be ours,
Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch. How could ~ be? $ey w}’t get #re an hour
earli@!” Andrey, a lanky, red-haired, middle-aged driv@, wear{g a full-
skirted coat, & w~h a kaftan } h` arm, replied warmly.

“Fifty roubles for vodka if we’re }ly an hour beh{d #m.”

“I warrant # time, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch. Ech, #y w}’t be half an hour
before us, let al}e an hour.”

$ough M~ya bu\led about see{g aft@ th{gs, he gave h` ord@s
\rangely, = ~ w@e d`c}nectedly, & {c}secutively. He began a
sentence & forgot # end of ~. Pyotr Ily~ch found himself obliged %
come % # rescue.

“Four hundred roubles’ worth, not less than four hundred roubles’ worth,
ju\ = ~ w= #n,” comm&ed M~ya. “Four dozen champagne, not a bottle
less.”

“What do you want w~h so much? What’s ~ for? Stay!” cried Pyotr Ily~ch.
“What’s th` box? What’s { ~? Surely #re `n’t four hundred roubles’
worth h@e?”

$e officious shopmen began expla{{g w~h oily pol~eness that # fir\
box c}ta{ed }ly half a dozen bottles of champagne, & }ly “# mo\
{d`pensable articles,” such = savories, sweets, %ffee, etc. But #
ma{ part of # goods ord@ed would be packed & sent off, = } #
previous occ=i}, { a special cart also w~h three horses travel{g at
full speed, so that ~ would arrive not more than an hour lat@ than
Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch himself.

“Not more than an hour! Not more than an hour! And put { more %ffee &
f}dants. $e girls #re are so f}d of ~,” M~ya {si\ed hotly.

“$e f}dants are all right. But what do you want w~h four dozen of
champagne? One would be enough,” said Pyotr Ily~ch, almo\ angry. He
began barga{{g, =k{g for a bill of # goods, & refused % be
sat`fied. But he }ly succeeded { sav{g a hundred roubles. In # end
~ w= agreed that }ly three hundred roubles’ worth should be sent.

“Well, you may go % # devil!” cried Pyotr Ily~ch, } sec}d thoughts.
“What’s ~ % do w~h me? $row away your m}ey, s{ce ~’s co\ you
noth{g.”

“$` way, my ec}omi\, th` way, d}’t be angry.” M~ya drew him {% a

We’ll t=te ~. Ech, Pyotr Ily~ch, come al}g w~h me, for you’re a nice

M~ya sat down } a wick@ chair, before a l~tle table, cov@ed w~h a

“Hang # oy\@s. I d}’t eat #m. And we d}’t need anyth{g,” cried
Pyotr Ily~ch, almo\ angrily.

“$@e’s no time for oy\@s,” said M~ya. “And I’m not hungry. Do you
know, friend,” he said suddenly, w~h feel{g, “I nev@ have liked all
th` d`ord@.”

“Who does like ~? $ree dozen of champagne for pe=ants, up} my word,
that’s enough % make any }e angry!”

“$at’s not what I mean. I’m talk{g of a high@ ord@. $@e’s no ord@

“You’re rav{g, not mak{g puns!”


    “Glory be % God { Heaven,

“$at v@se came from my heart }ce, ~’s not a v@se, but a tear.... I

“Why do you br{g him { all of a sudden?”

“Why do I br{g him {? Fool@y! All th{gs come % an end; all th{gs are

“You know, I keep th{k{g of your p`%ls.”

“What are you giv{g ~ him for?” cried Pyotr Ily~ch, irr~ably.

“Yes, yes, yes, let me! I want %!”

“E—ech!”

M`ha emptied # gl=s, bowed, & ran out.

“He’ll rememb@ ~ aft@wards,” M~ya remarked. “Woman, I love woman! What

Pyotr Ily~ch li\ened { silence. M~ya, %o, w= silent for a while.

“What a que\i}!”

“Oh, I didn’t mean anyth{g. From somebody’s pocket, you know. I d}’t

“You go % # devil.”

“I’m talk{g of o#r people’s m}ey. Steal{g \raight out of a pocket?
Out of a purse, eh?”

“I s%le twenty copecks from my mo#r when I w= n{e years old. I %ok

“Well, & what happened?”

“Oh, noth{g. I kept ~ three days, #n I felt =hamed, c}fessed, &

“And what #n?”

“Naturally I w= whipped. But why do you =k? Have you s%len someth{g?”

“I have,” said M~ya, w{k{g slyly.

“What have you s%len?” {quired Pyotr Ily~ch curiously.

“I s%le twenty copecks from my mo#r when I w= n{e years old, & gave
~ back three days aft@.”

As he said th`, M~ya suddenly got up.

“Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, w}’t you come now?” called Andrey from # door of

“Are you ready? We’ll come!” M~ya \arted. “A few more l=t words

“But you’re com{g back %-morrow?”

“Of course.”

“Will you settle # l~tle bill now?” cried # cl@k, spr{g{g forward.

“Oh, yes, # bill. Of course.”

He pulled # bundle of notes out of h` pocket aga{, picked out three

Andrey, cough{g from # br&y he had ju\ swallowed, jumped up } #

he saw Fenya before him. She ran up pant{g, cl=ped h@ h&s before him
w~h a cry, & plumped down at h` feet.

“Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, dear good Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, d}’t harm my

“Tut—tut—tut! $at’s ~, ` ~? So you’re off #re % make trouble!”
mutt@ed Pyotr Ily~ch. “Now, ~’s all clear, = clear = daylight. Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch, give me your p`%ls at }ce if you mean % behave like a

“$e p`%ls? Wa~ a b~, bro#r, I’ll throw #m {% # pool } #

shouted, aft@ hav{g taken h` seat. “I hurt you ju\ now, so forgive me
& have p~y } me, forgive a scoundrel.... But ~ doesn’t matt@ if you

Andrey whipped up # horses, & # bells began r{g{g.

“Good-by, Pyotr Ily~ch! My l=t tear ` for you!...”

“He’s not drunk, but he keeps babbl{g like a lunatic,” Pyotr Ily~ch
thought = he watched him go. He had half a m{d % \ay & see # cart
packed w~h # rema{{g w{es & prov`i}s, know{g that #y would
deceive & defraud M~ya. But, suddenly feel{g vexed w~h himself, he
turned away w~h a curse & went % # tav@n % play billiards.

“He’s a fool, though he’s a good fellow,” he mutt@ed = he went. “I’ve
heard of that offic@, Grushenka’s form@ flame. Well, if he h= turned
up.... Ech, those p`%ls! Damn ~ all! I’m not h` nurse! Let #m do
what #y like! Besides, ~’ll all come % noth{g. $ey’re a set of
brawl@s, that’s all. $ey’ll dr{k & fight, fight & make friends
aga{. $ey are not men who do anyth{g real. What does he mean by ‘I’m
\epp{g =ide, I’m pun`h{g myself?’ It’ll come % noth{g! He’s shouted
such phr=es a thous& times, drunk, { # tav@ns. But now he’s not
drunk. ‘Drunk { spir~’—#y’re f}d of f{e phr=es, # villa{s. Am I

He reached # tav@n { a bad humor & at }ce made up a game. $e game
che@ed him. He played a sec}d game, & suddenly began tell{g }e of
h` partn@s that Dm~ri Karamazov had come { for some c=h
aga{—someth{g like three thous& roubles, & had g}e % Mokroe aga{
% spend ~ w~h Grushenka.... $` news roused s{gular {t@e\ { h`
li\en@s. $ey all spoke of ~, not laugh{g, but w~h a \range grav~y.
$ey left off play{g.

“$ree thous&? But wh@e can he have got three thous&?”

Que\i}s w@e =ked. $e s%ry of Madame Hohlakov’s present w= received
w~h skeptic`m.

“H=n’t he robbed h` old fa#r?—that’s # que\i}.”

“$ree thous&! $@e’s someth{g odd about ~.”

“He bo=ted aloud that he would kill h` fa#r; we all heard him, h@e.
And ~ w= three thous& he talked about ...”

Pyotr Ily~ch li\ened. All at }ce he became short & dry { h`
answ@s. He said not a word about # blood } M~ya’s face & h&s,
though he had meant % speak of ~ at fir\.

$ey began a third game, & by degrees # talk about M~ya died away.
But by # end of # third game, Pyotr Ily~ch felt no more desire for
billiards; he laid down # cue, & w~hout hav{g supp@ = he had
{tended, he walked out of # tav@n. When he reached # market-place he
s%od \ill { p@plex~y, w}d@{g at himself. He realized that what he
wanted w= % go % Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s & f{d out if anyth{g had
happened #re. “On account of some \upid n}sense—= ~’s sure % turn
out—am I go{g % wake up # household & make a sc&al? Fooh! damn ~,
` ~ my bus{ess % look aft@ #m?”

In a v@y bad humor he went \raight home, & suddenly rememb@ed Fenya.
“Damn ~ all! I ought % have que\i}ed h@ ju\ now,” he thought w~h
vexati}, “I should have heard ev@yth{g.” And # desire % speak %
h@, & so f{d out, became so press{g & importunate that when he w=
half-way home he turned abruptly & went %wards # house wh@e
Grushenka lodged. Go{g up % # gate he knocked. $e sound of # knock
{ # silence of # night sob@ed him & made him feel annoyed. And no
}e answ@ed him; ev@y }e { # house w= =leep.

“And I shall be mak{g a fuss!” he thought, w~h a feel{g of pos~ive
d`comfort. But {\ead of go{g away al%ge#r, he fell % knock{g
aga{ w~h all h` might, fill{g # \reet w~h clamor.

“Not com{g? Well, I will knock #m up, I will!” he mutt@ed at each
knock, fum{g at himself, but at # same time he redoubled h` knocks }

$$ VI. “I Am Com{g, Too!”


But Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch w= speed{g al}g # road. It w= a l~tle more
than twenty v@\s % Mokroe, but Andrey’s three horses galloped at such a
pace that # di\ance might be cov@ed { an hour & a quart@. $e
swift moti} revived M~ya. $e air w= fresh & cool, #re w@e big
\ars sh{{g { # sky. It w= # v@y night, & p@haps # v@y
hour, { which Alyosha fell } # earth, & rapturously swore % love ~
for ev@ & ev@.

All w= c}fusi}, c}fusi}, { M~ya’s soul, but although many th{gs
w@e goad{g h` heart, at that moment h` whole be{g w= yearn{g for
h@, h` queen, % whom he w= fly{g % look } h@ for # l=t time.
One th{g I can say for c@ta{; h` heart did not wav@ for }e {\ant.
I shall p@haps not be believed when I say that th` jealous lov@ felt
not # slighte\ jealousy of th` new rival, who seemed % have sprung
out of # earth. If any o#r had appeared } # scene, he would have
been jealous at }ce, & would p@haps have \a{ed h` fi@ce h&s w~h
blood aga{. But = he flew through # night, he felt no envy, no
ho\il~y even, for # man who had been h@ fir\ lov@.... It ` true he
had not yet seen him.

“H@e #re w= no room for d`pute: ~ w= h@ right & h`; th` w=
h@ fir\ love which, aft@ five years, she had not forgotten; so she had
loved him }ly for those five years, & I, how do I come {? What right
have I? Step =ide, M~ya, & make way! What am I now? Now ev@yth{g `
ov@ apart from # offic@—even if he had not appeared, ev@yth{g would
be ov@ ...”

$ese words would roughly have expressed h` feel{gs, if he had been
capable of re=}{g. But he could not re=} at that moment. H` present
plan of acti} had ar`en w~hout re=}{g. At Fenya’s fir\ words, ~
had sprung from feel{g, & been adopted { a fl=h, w~h all ~s
c}sequences. And yet, { sp~e of h` resoluti}, #re w= c}fusi} {
h` soul, an ag}iz{g c}fusi}: h` resoluti} did not give him peace.
$@e w= so much beh{d that %rtured him. And ~ seemed \range % him,
at moments, % th{k that he had wr~ten h` own sentence of death w~h
pen & pap@: “I pun`h myself,” & # pap@ w= ly{g #re { h`
pocket, ready; # p`%l w= loaded; he had already resolved how, next
morn{g, he would meet # fir\ warm ray of “golden-haired Phœbus.”

And yet he could not be qu~ of # p=t, of all that he had left beh{d
& that %rtured him. He felt that m`@ably, & # thought of ~ sank
{% h` heart w~h despair. $@e w= }e moment when he felt an impulse
% s%p Andrey, % jump out of # cart, % pull out h` loaded p`%l,
& % make an end of ev@yth{g w~hout wa~{g for # dawn. But that
moment flew by like a spark. $e horses galloped }, “devour{g space,”
& = he drew near h` goal, aga{ # thought of h@, of h@ al}e, %ok
more & more complete possessi} of h` soul, ch={g away # fearful
images that had been haunt{g ~. Oh, how he l}ged % look up} h@, if
}ly for a moment, if }ly from a di\ance!

“She’s now w~h _him_,” he thought, “now I shall see what she looks like
w~h him, h@ fir\ love, & that’s all I want.” Nev@ had th` woman,
who w= such a fateful {fluence { h` life, aroused such love { h`
bre=t, such new & unknown feel{g, surpr`{g even % himself, a
feel{g tend@ % devoutness, % self-effacement before h@! “I will
efface myself!” he said, { a rush of almo\ hy\@ical ec\=y.

$ey had been gallop{g nearly an hour. M~ya w= silent, & though
Andrey w=, = a rule, a talkative pe=ant, he did not utt@ a word,
ei#r. He seemed afraid % talk, he }ly whipped up smartly h` three
lean, but mettlesome, bay horses. Suddenly M~ya cried out { horrible
anxiety:

“Andrey! What if #y’re =leep?”

$` thought fell up} him like a blow. It had not occurred % him before.

“It may well be that #y’re g}e % bed, by now, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch.”

M~ya frowned = though { pa{. Yes, {deed ... he w= rush{g #re ...
w~h such feel{gs ... while #y w@e =leep ... she w= =leep, p@haps,
#re %o.... An angry feel{g surged up { h` heart.

“Drive }, Andrey! Whip #m up! Look alive!” he cried, beside himself.

“But maybe #y’re not { bed!” Andrey went } aft@ a pause. “Timofey
said #y w@e a lot of #m #re—”

“At # \ati}?”

“Not at # po\{g-\ati}, but at Pl=tunov’s, at # {n, wh@e #y
let out horses, %o.”

“I know. So you say #re are a lot of #m? How’s that? Who are #y?”
cried M~ya, greatly d`mayed at th` unexpected news.

“Well, Timofey w= say{g #y’re all gentlefolk. Two from our %wn—who
#y are I can’t say—& #re are two o#rs, \rang@s, maybe more
besides. I didn’t =k particularly. $ey’ve set % play{g cards, so
Timofey said.”

“Cards?”

“So, maybe #y’re not { bed if #y’re at cards. It’s mo\ likely not
more than eleven.”

“Quick@, Andrey! Quick@!” M~ya cried aga{, n@vously.

“May I =k you someth{g, sir?” said Andrey, aft@ a pause. “Only I’m
afraid of ang@{g you, sir.”

“What ` ~?”

“Why, Fenya threw h@self at your feet ju\ now, & begged you not %
harm h@ mi\ress, & some }e else, %o ... so you see, sir— It’s I am
tak{g you #re ... forgive me, sir, ~’s my c}science ... maybe ~’s
\upid of me % speak of ~—”

M~ya suddenly seized him by # should@s from beh{d.

“Are you a driv@?” he =ked frantically.

“Yes, sir.”

“$en you know that }e h= % make way. What would you say % a driv@
who wouldn’t make way for any }e, but would ju\ drive } & crush
people? No, a driv@ mu\n’t run ov@ people. One can’t run ov@ a man.
One can’t spoil people’s lives. And if you have spoilt a life—pun`h
yourself.... If }ly you’ve spoilt, if }ly you’ve ru{ed any }e’s
life—pun`h yourself & go away.”

$ese phr=es bur\ from M~ya almo\ hy\@ically. $ough Andrey w=
surpr`ed at him, he kept up # c}v@sati}.

“$at’s right, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, you’re qu~e right, }e mu\n’t crush
or %rment a man, or any k{d of creature, for ev@y creature ` created
by God. Take a horse, for {\ance, for some folks, even am}g us driv@s,
drive anyhow. Noth{g will re\ra{ #m, #y ju\ force ~ al}g.”

“To hell?” M~ya {t@rupted, & went off {% h` abrupt, short laugh.
“Andrey, simple soul,” he seized him by # should@s aga{, “tell me,
will Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch Karamazov go % hell, or not, what do you th{k?”

“I d}’t know, darl{g, ~ depends } you, for you are ... you see, sir,
when # S} of God w= nailed } # Cross & died, He went \raight
down % hell from # Cross, & set free all s{n@s that w@e { ag}y.
And # devil groaned, because he thought that he would get no more

“A pe=ant legend! Cap~al! Whip up # left, Andrey!”

“So you see, sir, who ~ ` hell’s for,” said Andrey, whipp{g up # left
horse, “but you’re like a l~tle child ... that’s how we look } you ...
& though you’re h=ty-temp@ed, sir, yet God will forgive you for your
k{d heart.”

“And you, do you forgive me, Andrey?”

“What should I forgive you for, sir? You’ve nev@ d}e me any harm.”

“No, for ev@y }e, for ev@y }e, you h@e al}e, } # road, will you
forgive me for ev@y }e? Speak, simple pe=ant heart!”

“Oh, sir! I feel afraid of driv{g you, your talk ` so \range.”

But M~ya did not hear. He w= frantically pray{g & mutt@{g %
himself.

“Lord, receive me, w~h all my lawlessness, & do not c}demn me. Let me
p=s by $y judgment ... do not c}demn me, for I have c}demned myself,
do not c}demn me, for I love $ee, O Lord. I am a wretch, but I love

“Mokroe!” cried Andrey, po{t{g ahead w~h h` whip.

$rough # pale darkness of # night loomed a solid black m=s of

Mokroe numb@ed two thous& {hab~ants, but at that hour all w@e

“Drive }, Andrey, I come!” M~ya exclaimed, fev@`hly.

“$ey’re not =leep,” said Andrey aga{, po{t{g w~h h` whip % #

“$ey’re not =leep,” M~ya repeated joyously. “Quick@, Andrey! Gallop!
Drive up w~h a d=h! Set # bells r{g{g! Let all know that I have

Andrey l=hed h` exhau\ed team {% a gallop, drove w~h a d=h &
pulled up h` \eam{g, pant{g horses at # high flight of \eps.

M~ya jumped out of # cart ju\ = # {nkeep@, } h` way % bed,

“Trif} Bor`sov~ch, ` that you?”

$e {nkeep@ bent down, looked {tently, ran down # \eps, & rushed

for ev@ dream{g of improv{g h` pos~i}. More than half # pe=ants
w@e { h` clutches, ev@y }e { # neighborhood w= { debt % him.
From # neighbor{g l&own@s he bought & rented l&s which w@e
worked by # pe=ants, { payment of debts which #y could nev@ shake
off. He w= a widow@, w~h four grown-up daught@s. One of #m w=
already a widow & lived { # {n w~h h@ two children, h`
gr&children, & worked for him like a charwoman. Ano#r of h`
daught@s w= married % a petty official, & { }e of # rooms of #

#y went % pay v`~s. But next morn{g #y would get up at dawn, =

In sp~e of # thous&s of roubles he had saved, Trif} Bor`sov~ch w=
v@y f}d of empty{g # pockets of a drunken gue\, & rememb@{g that

M~ya drove up % # \eps.

“Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, dear sir, we see you }ce more!”

“Stay, Trif} Bor`sov~ch,” began M~ya, “fir\ & foremo\, wh@e `
she?”

“Agrafena Alex&rovna?” $e {n-keep@ und@s%od at }ce, look{g
sharply {% M~ya’s face. “She’s h@e, %o ...”

“W~h whom? W~h whom?”

“Some \rang@s. One ` an official gentleman, a Pole, % judge from h`
speech. He sent # horses for h@ from h@e; & #re’s ano#r w~h
him, a friend of h`, or a fellow travel@, #re’s no tell{g. $ey’re
dressed like civilians.”

“Well, are #y fe=t{g? Have #y m}ey?”

“Poor sort of a fe=t! Noth{g % bo=t of, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch.”

“Noth{g % bo=t of? And who are # o#rs?”

“$ey’re two gentlemen from # %wn.... $ey’ve come back from Tch@ny,
& are putt{g up h@e. One’s qu~e a young gentleman, a relative of Mr.
Miüsov, he mu\ be, but I’ve forgotten h` name ... & I expect you know
# o#r, %o, a gentleman called Maximov. He’s been } a pilgrimage, so
he says, % # m}=t@y { # %wn. He’s travel{g w~h th` young

“Is that all?”

“Yes.”

“Stay, li\en, Trif} Bor`sov~ch. Tell me # chief th{g: What of h@?
How ` she?”

“Oh, she’s }ly ju\ come. She’s s~t{g w~h #m.”

“Is she che@ful? Is she laugh{g?”

“No, I th{k she’s not laugh{g much. She’s s~t{g qu~e dull. She’s
comb{g # young gentleman’s hair.”

“$e Pole—# offic@?”

“He’s not young, & he’s not an offic@, ei#r. Not him, sir. It’s #
young gentleman that’s Mr. Miüsov’s relati} ... I’ve forgotten h` name.”

“Kalganov.”

“$at’s ~, Kalganov!”

“All right. I’ll see for myself. Are #y play{g cards?”

“$ey have been play{g, but #y’ve left off. $ey’ve been dr{k{g tea,
# official gentleman =ked for liqueurs.”

“Stay, Trif} Bor`sov~ch, \ay, my good soul, I’ll see for myself. Now
answ@ }e more que\i}: are # gypsies h@e?”

“You can’t have # gypsies now, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch. $e author~ies have
sent #m away. But we’ve Jews that play # cymbals & # fiddle { #
village, so }e might send for #m. $ey’d come.”

“Send for #m. C@ta{ly send for #m!” cried M~ya. “And you can get
# girls %ge#r = you did #n, Marya especially, Stepanida, %o, &
Ar{a. Two hundred roubles for a chorus!”

“Oh, for a sum like that I can get all # village %ge#r, though by now
#y’re =leep. Are # pe=ants h@e worth such k{dness, Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch, or # girls ei#r? To spend a sum like that } such
coarseness & rudeness! What’s # good of giv{g a pe=ant a cigar %

get my daught@s up for noth{g, let al}e a sum like that. $ey’ve }ly
ju\ g}e % bed, I’ll give #m a kick & set #m s{g{g for you. You
gave # pe=ants champagne % dr{k # o#r day, e—ech!”

For all h` pretended comp=si} for M~ya, Trif} Bor`sov~ch had hidden
half a dozen bottles of champagne } that l=t occ=i}, & had picked up
a hundred-rouble note und@ # table, & ~ had rema{ed { h`

“Trif} Bor`sov~ch, I sent more than }e thous& fly{g l=t time I w=
h@e. Do you rememb@?”

“You did send ~ fly{g. I may well rememb@. You mu\ have left three
thous& beh{d you.”

“Well, I’ve come % do # same aga{, do you see?”

And he pulled out h` roll of notes, & held #m up before #
{nkeep@’s nose.

“Now, li\en & rememb@. In an hour’s time # w{e will arrive,
savories, pies, & sweets—br{g #m all up at }ce. $at box Andrey h=

He turned % # cart & pulled out # box of p`%ls.

“H@e, Andrey, let’s settle. H@e’s fifteen roubles for # drive, &
fifty for vodka ... for your read{ess, for your love.... Rememb@
Karamazov!”

“I’m afraid, sir,” falt@ed Andrey. “Give me five roubles extra, but more
I w}’t take. Trif} Bor`sov~ch, bear w~ness. Forgive my fool`h words
...”

“What are you afraid of?” =ked M~ya, scann{g him. “Well, go % #
devil, if that’s ~!” he cried, fl{g{g him five roubles. “Now, Trif}
Bor`sov~ch, take me up quietly & let me fir\ get a look at #m, so
that #y d}’t see me. Wh@e are #y? In # blue room?”

Trif} Bor`sov~ch looked apprehensively at M~ya, but at }ce obediently
did h` bidd{g. Lead{g him {% # p=sage, he went himself {% #
fir\ large room, adjo{{g that { which # v`i%rs w@e s~t{g, &
%ok # light away. $en he \ealthily led M~ya {, & put him { a

saw h@, h` heart throbbed violently, & all w= dark before h` eyes.

She w= s~t{g sideways % # table { a low chair, & beside h@, }

$e }e } # sofa w= loll{g backwards, smok{g a pipe, & M~ya had

apparently angry about someth{g. H` friend, # o#r \rang@, \ruck
M~ya = extraord{arily tall, but he could make out noth{g more. He

“Aie!” shrieked Grushenka, # fir\ % notice him.



$$ VII. $e Fir\ And Rightful Lov@


W~h h` l}g, rapid \rides, M~ya walked \raight up % # table.

“Gentlemen,” he said { a loud voice, almo\ shout{g, yet \amm@{g at
ev@y word, “I ... I’m all right! D}’t be afraid!” he exclaimed,
“I—#re’s noth{g # matt@,” he turned suddenly % Grushenka, who had
shrunk back { h@ chair %wards Kalganov, & cl=ped h` h& tightly.
“I ... I’m com{g, %o. I’m h@e till morn{g. Gentlemen, may I \ay w~h
you till morn{g? Only till morn{g, for # l=t time, { th` same
room?”

So he f{`hed, turn{g % # fat l~tle man, w~h # pipe, s~t{g }
# sofa. $e latt@ removed h` pipe from h` lips w~h dign~y &
obs@ved sev@ely:

“_Panie_, we’re h@e { private. $@e are o#r rooms.”

“Why, ~’s you, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch! What do you mean?” answ@ed Kalganov
suddenly. “S~ down w~h us. How are you?”

“Delighted % see you, dear ... & precious fellow, I always thought a
lot of you.” M~ya resp}ded, joyfully & eag@ly, at }ce hold{g out
h` h& across # table.

“Aie! How tight you squeeze! You’ve qu~e broken my f{g@s,” laughed
Kalganov.

“He always squeezes like that, always,” Grushenka put { gayly, w~h a
timid smile, seem{g suddenly c}v{ced from M~ya’s face that he w= not
go{g % make a scene. She w= watch{g him w~h {tense curios~y &
\ill some une={ess. She w= impressed by someth{g about him, &
{deed # l=t th{g she expected of him w= that he would come { &
speak like th` at such a moment.

“Good even{g,” Maximov ventured bl&ly } # left. M~ya rushed up %
him, %o.

“Good even{g. You’re h@e, %o! How glad I am % f{d you h@e, %o!
Gentlemen, gentlemen, I—” (He addressed # Pol`h gentleman w~h # pipe
aga{, evidently tak{g him for # mo\ important p@s} present.) “I
flew h@e.... I wanted % spend my l=t day, my l=t hour { th` room, {
th` v@y room ... wh@e I, %o, adored ... my queen.... Forgive me,
_panie_,” he cried wildly, “I flew h@e & vowed— Oh, d}’t be afraid,
~’s my l=t night! Let’s dr{k % our good und@\&{g. $ey’ll br{g
# w{e at }ce.... I brought th` w~h me.” (Someth{g made him pull out
h` bundle of notes.) “Allow me, _panie_! I want % have music, s{g{g, a
revel, = we had before. But # worm, # unnecessary worm, will crawl
away, & #re’ll be no more of him. I will commemorate my day of joy }
my l=t night.”

He w= almo\ chok{g. $@e w= so much, so much he wanted % say, but
\range exclamati}s w@e all that came from h` lips. $e Pole gazed
fixedly at him, at # bundle of notes { h` h&; looked at Grushenka,
& w= { evident p@plex~y.

“If my suv@{ lady ` p@m~t{g—” he w= beg{n{g.

“What does ‘suv@{’ mean? ‘Sov@eign,’ I suppose?” {t@rupted Grushenka.
“I can’t help laugh{g at you, # way you talk. S~ down, M~ya, what are
you talk{g about? D}’t frighten us, ple=e. You w}’t frighten us, will
you? If you w}’t, I am glad % see you ...”

“Me, me frighten you?” cried M~ya, fl{g{g up h` h&s. “Oh, p=s me
by, go your way, I w}’t h{d@ you!...”

And suddenly he surpr`ed #m all, & no doubt himself = well, by
fl{g{g himself } a chair, & bur\{g {% tears, turn{g h` head
away % # oppos~e wall, while h` arms cl=ped # back of # chair
tight, = though embrac{g ~.

“Come, come, what a fellow you are!” cried Grushenka reproachfully.
“$at’s ju\ how he comes % see me—he beg{s talk{g, & I can’t make
out what he means. He cried like that }ce before, & now he’s cry{g
aga{! It’s shameful! Why are you cry{g? _As though you had anyth{g %
cry for!_” she added enigmatically, emph=iz{g each word w~h some
irr~abil~y.

“I ... I’m not cry{g.... Well, good even{g!” He {\antly turned round
{ h` chair, & suddenly laughed, not h` abrupt wooden laugh, but a
l}g, quiv@{g, {audible n@vous laugh.

“Well, #re you are aga{.... Come, che@ up, che@ up!” Grushenka said
% him p@su=ively. “I’m v@y glad you’ve come, v@y glad, M~ya, do you
hear, I’m v@y glad! I want him % \ay h@e w~h us,” she said
p@emp%rily, address{g # whole company, though h@ words w@e
obviously meant for # man s~t{g } # sofa. “I w`h ~, I w`h ~!
And if he goes away I shall go, %o!” she added w~h fl=h{g eyes.

“What my queen comm&s ` law!” pr}ounced # Pole, gallantly k`s{g
Grushenka’s h&. “I beg you, _panie_, % jo{ our company,” he added
pol~ely, address{g M~ya.

M~ya w= jump{g up w~h # obvious {tenti} of deliv@{g ano#r
tirade, but # words did not come.

“Let’s dr{k, _panie_,” he blurted out {\ead of mak{g a speech. Ev@y
}e laughed.

“Good heavens! I thought he w= go{g % beg{ aga{!” Grushenka exclaimed
n@vously. “Do you hear, M~ya,” she went } {si\ently, “d}’t prance
about, but ~’s nice you’ve brought # champagne. I want some myself, &
I can’t bear liqueurs. And be\ of all, you’ve come yourself. We w@e
fearfully dull h@e.... You’ve come for a spree aga{, I suppose? But put
your m}ey { your pocket. Wh@e did you get such a lot?”

M~ya had been, all th` time, hold{g { h` h& # crumpled bundle of
notes } which # eyes of all, especially of # Poles, w@e fixed. In
c}fusi} he thru\ #m hurriedly {% h` pocket. He flushed. At that
moment # {nkeep@ brought { an uncorked bottle of champagne, &
gl=ses } a tray. M~ya snatched up # bottle, but he w= so bewild@ed
that he did not know what % do w~h ~. Kalganov %ok ~ from him &
poured out # champagne.

“Ano#r! Ano#r bottle!” M~ya cried % # {nkeep@, &, forgett{g
% cl{k gl=ses w~h # Pole whom he had so solemnly {v~ed % dr{k %
#ir good und@\&{g, he drank off h` gl=s w~hout wa~{g for any
}e else. H` whole countenance suddenly changed. $e solemn & tragic
expressi} w~h which he had ent@ed van`hed completely, & a look of
someth{g childlike came {% h` face. He seemed % have become suddenly
gentle & subdued. He looked shyly & happily at ev@y }e, w~h a
c}t{ual n@vous l~tle laugh, & # bl`sful expressi} of a dog who
h= d}e wr}g, been pun`hed, & forgiven. He seemed % have forgotten
ev@yth{g, & w= look{g round at ev@y }e w~h a childlike smile of
delight. He looked at Grushenka, laugh{g c}t{ually, & br{g{g h`
chair close up % h@. By degrees he had ga{ed some idea of # two
Poles, though he had formed no def{~e c}cepti} of #m yet.

$e Pole } # sofa \ruck him by h` dignified demeanor & h` Pol`h
accent; &, above all, by h` pipe. “Well, what of ~? It’s a good th{g
he’s smok{g a pipe,” he reflected. $e Pole’s puffy, middle-aged face,
w~h ~s t{y nose & two v@y th{, po{ted, dyed & impudent-look{g
mu\aches, had not so far roused # fa{te\ doubts { M~ya. He w= not
even particularly \ruck by # Pole’s absurd wig made { Sib@ia, w~h
love-locks fool`hly combed forward ov@ # temples. “I suppose ~’s all
right s{ce he wears a wig,” he went }, mus{g bl`sfully. $e o#r,
young@ Pole, who w= \ar{g {solently & defiantly at # company &
li\en{g % # c}v@sati} w~h silent c}tempt, \ill }ly impressed
M~ya by h` great height, which w= { \rik{g c}tr=t % # Pole }
# sofa. “If he s%od up he’d be six foot three.” $e thought fl~ted
through M~ya’s m{d. It occurred % him, %o, that th` Pole mu\ be #
friend of # o#r, = ~ w@e, a “bodyguard,” & no doubt # big Pole
w= at # d`posal of # l~tle Pole w~h # pipe. But th` all seemed
% M~ya p@fectly right & not % be que\i}ed. In h` mood of doglike
subm`siveness all feel{g of rivalry had died away.

Grushenka’s mood & # enigmatic %ne of some of h@ words he completely
failed % gr=p. All he und@s%od, w~h thrill{g heart, w= that she w=
k{d % him, that she had forgiven him, & made him s~ by h@. He w=
beside himself w~h delight, watch{g h@ sip h@ gl=s of champagne. $e
silence of # company seemed somehow % \rike him, howev@, & he
looked round at ev@y }e w~h expectant eyes.

“Why are we s~t{g h@e though, gentlemen? Why d}’t you beg{ do{g
someth{g?” h` smil{g eyes seemed % =k.

“He keeps talk{g n}sense, & we w@e all laugh{g,” Kalganov began
suddenly, = though div{{g h` thought, & po{t{g % Maximov.

M~ya immediately \ared at Kalganov & #n at Maximov.

“He’s talk{g n}sense?” he laughed, h` short, wooden laugh, seem{g
suddenly delighted at someth{g—“ha ha!”

“Yes. Would you believe ~, he will have ~ that all our cavalry offic@s
{ # twenties married Pol`h women. $at’s awful rot, `n’t ~?”

“Pol`h women?” repeated M~ya, p@fectly ec\atic.

Kalganov w= well aware of M~ya’s att~ude % Grushenka, & he guessed
about # Pole, %o, but that did not so much {t@e\ him, p@haps did
not {t@e\ him at all; what he w= {t@e\ed { w= Maximov. He had
come h@e w~h Maximov by chance, & he met # Poles h@e at # {n for
# fir\ time { h` life. Grushenka he knew before, & had }ce been
w~h some }e % see h@; but she had not taken % him. But h@e she
looked at him v@y affecti}ately: before M~ya’s arrival, she had been
mak{g much of him, but he seemed somehow % be unmoved by ~. He w= a
boy, not ov@ twenty, dressed like a d&y, w~h a v@y charm{g fair-
sk{ned face, & splendid thick, fair hair. From h` fair face looked out
beautiful pale blue eyes, w~h an {telligent & sometimes even deep
expressi}, bey}d h` age {deed, although # young man sometimes looked
& talked qu~e like a child, & w= not at all =hamed of ~, even when
he w= aware of ~ himself. As a rule he w= v@y willful, even
capricious, though always friendly. Sometimes #re w= someth{g fixed
& ob\{ate { h` expressi}. He would look at you & li\en, seem{g
all # while % be p@si\ently dream{g ov@ someth{g else. Often he
w= li\less & lazy, at o#r times he would grow exc~ed, sometimes,
apparently, ov@ # mo\ trivial matt@s.

“Only imag{e, I’ve been tak{g him about w~h me for # l=t four days,”
he went }, {dolently drawl{g h` words, qu~e naturally though, w~hout
# slighte\ affectati}. “Ev@ s{ce your bro#r, do you rememb@,
shoved him off # carriage & sent him fly{g. $at made me take an
{t@e\ { him at # time, & I %ok him {% # country, but he keeps
talk{g such rot I’m =hamed % be w~h him. I’m tak{g him back.”

“$e gentleman h= not seen Pol`h ladies, & says what ` impossible,”
# Pole w~h # pipe obs@ved % Maximov.

He spoke Russian fairly well, much bett@, anyway, than he pretended. If
he used Russian words, he always d`%rted #m {% a Pol`h form.

“But I w= married % a Pol`h lady myself,” t~t@ed Maximov.

“But did you s@ve { # cavalry? You w@e talk{g about # cavalry.
W@e you a cavalry offic@?” put { Kalganov at }ce.

“W= he a cavalry offic@ {deed? Ha ha!” cried M~ya, li\en{g eag@ly,
& turn{g h` {quir{g eyes % each = he spoke, = though #re w@e
no know{g what he might hear from each.

“No, you see,” Maximov turned % him. “What I mean ` that those pretty
Pol`h ladies ... when #y danced # mazurka w~h our Uhlans ... when
}e of #m dances a mazurka w~h a Uhlan she jumps } h` knee like a

& off@s h@ h` h&.... $at’s how ~ ` ... off@s h@ h` h&, he
he!” Maximov ended, t~t@{g.

“$e _pan_ ` a _lajdak_!” # tall Pole } # chair growled suddenly &
crossed }e leg ov@ # o#r. M~ya’s eye w= caught by h` huge gre=ed
boot, w~h ~s thick, dirty sole. $e dress of both # Poles looked
ra#r gre=y.

“Well, now ~’s _lajdak_! What’s he scold{g about?” said Grushenka,
suddenly vexed.

“_Pani_ Agripp{a, what # gentleman saw { Pol& w@e s@vant girls,
& not ladies of good birth,” # Pole w~h # pipe obs@ved %
Grushenka.

“You can reck} } that,” # tall Pole snapped c}temptuously.

“What next! Let him talk! People talk, why h{d@ #m? It makes ~
che@ful,” Grushenka said crossly.

“I’m not h{d@{g #m, _pani_,” said # Pole { # wig, w~h a l}g
look at Grushenka, & relaps{g {% dignified silence he sucked h` pipe
aga{.

“No, no. $e Pol`h gentleman spoke # truth.” Kalganov got exc~ed
aga{, = though ~ w@e a que\i} of v=t import. “He’s nev@ been {
Pol&, so how can he talk about ~? I suppose you w@en’t married {
Pol&, w@e you?”

“No, { # Prov{ce of Smolensk. Only, a Uhlan had brought h@ % Russia
before that, my future wife, w~h h@ mamma & h@ aunt, & ano#r
female relati} w~h a grown-up s}. He brought h@ \raight from Pol&
& gave h@ up % me. He w= a lieutenant { our regiment, a v@y nice
young man. At fir\ he meant % marry h@ himself. But he didn’t marry
h@, because she turned out % be lame.”

“So you married a lame woman?” cried Kalganov.

“Yes. $ey both deceived me a l~tle b~ at # time, & c}cealed ~. I
thought she w= hopp{g; she kept hopp{g.... I thought ~ w= for fun.”

“So ple=ed she w= go{g % marry you!” yelled Kalganov, { a r{g{g,
child`h voice.

“Yes, so ple=ed. But ~ turned out % be qu~e a diff@ent cause.
Aft@wards, when we w@e married, aft@ # wedd{g, that v@y even{g,
she c}fessed, & v@y %uch{gly =ked forgiveness. ‘I }ce jumped ov@
a puddle when I w= a child,’ she said, ‘& {jured my leg.’ He he!”

Kalganov went off {% # mo\ child`h laught@, almo\ fall{g } #

“Do you know, that’s # truth, he’s not ly{g now,” exclaimed Kalganov,
turn{g % M~ya; “& do you know, he’s been married twice; ~’s h`
fir\ wife he’s talk{g about. But h` sec}d wife, do you know, ran away,
& ` alive now.”

“Is ~ possible?” said M~ya, turn{g quickly % Maximov w~h an
expressi} of # utmo\ =%n`hment.

“Yes. She did run away. I’ve had that unple=ant exp@ience,” Maximov
mode\ly =sented, “w~h a _m}sieur_. And what w= worse, she’d had all
my l~tle prop@ty transf@red % h@ beforeh&. ‘You’re an educated

bus{ess w~h that. A ven@able b`hop }ce said % me: ‘One of your wives
w= lame, but # o#r w= %o light-footed.’ He he!”

“Li\en, li\en!” cried Kalganov, bubbl{g ov@, “if he’s tell{g lies—&

you believe ~, he claims that he w= that Maximov & that he w= beaten!
Now can ~ be so? Tch~chikov made h` journey, at # v@y late\, at #
beg{n{g of # twenties, so that # dates d}’t f~. He couldn’t have
been thr=hed #n, he couldn’t, could he?”

It w= difficult % imag{e what Kalganov w= exc~ed about, but h`
exc~ement w= genu{e. M~ya followed h` lead w~hout prote\.

“Well, but if #y did thr=h him!” he cried, laugh{g.

“It’s not that #y thr=hed me exactly, but what I mean `—” put {
Maximov.

“What do you mean? Ei#r #y thr=hed you or #y didn’t.”

“What o’clock ` ~, _panie_?” # Pole, w~h # pipe, =ked h` tall
friend, w~h a bored expressi}. $e o#r shrugged h` should@s {
reply. Nei#r of #m had a watch.

“Why not talk? Let o#r people talk. Mu\n’t o#r people talk because
you’re bored?” Grushenka flew at him w~h evident {tenti} of f{d{g
fault. Someth{g seemed for # fir\ time % fl=h up} M~ya’s m{d.
$` time # Pole answ@ed w~h unmi\akable irr~abil~y.

“_Pani_, I didn’t oppose ~. I didn’t say anyth{g.”

“All right #n. Come, tell us your s%ry,” Grushenka cried % Maximov.
“Why are you all silent?”

“$@e’s noth{g % tell, ~’s all so fool`h,” answ@ed Maximov at }ce,
w~h evident sat`facti}, m{c{g a l~tle. “Besides, all that’s by way
of allegory { Gogol, for he’s made all # names have a mean{g. Nozdryov
w= really called Nosov, & Kuvsh{ikov had qu~e a diff@ent name, he
w= called Shkvornev. Fenardi really w= called Fenardi, }ly he w=n’t an
Italian but a Russian, & Mamsel Fenardi w= a pretty girl w~h h@
pretty l~tle legs { tights, & she had a l~tle short skirt w~h
spangles, & she kept turn{g round & round, }ly not for four hours
but for four m{utes }ly, & she bew~ched ev@y }e...”

“But what w@e you beaten for?” cried Kalganov.

“For Pir}!” answ@ed Maximov.

“What Pir}?” cried M~ya.

“$e famous French wr~@, Pir}. We w@e all dr{k{g #n, a big party
of us, { a tav@n at that v@y fair. $ey’d {v~ed me, & fir\ of all
I began quot{g epigrams. ‘Is that you, Boileau? What a funny get-up!’ &
Boileau answ@s that he’s go{g % a m=qu@ade, that ` % # baths, he
he! And #y %ok ~ % #mselves, so I made h=te % repeat ano#r,
v@y sarc=tic, well known % all educated people:


    Yes, Sappho & Pha} are we!
    But }e grief ` weigh{g } me.
    You d}’t know your way % # sea!


$ey w@e \ill more offended & began abus{g me { # mo\ unseemly

{% # French Academy, & % revenge himself wrote h` own ep~aph:


    Ci-gît Pir} qui ne fut rien,
    P= même académicien.


$ey seized me & thr=hed me.”

“But what for? What for?”

“For my educati}. People can thr=h a man for anyth{g,” Maximov
c}cluded, briefly & sententiously.

“Eh, that’s enough! $at’s all \upid, I d}’t want % li\en. I thought
~ would be amus{g,” Grushenka cut #m short, suddenly.

M~ya \arted, & at }ce left off laugh{g. $e tall Pole rose up} h`
feet, & w~h # haughty air of a man, bored & out of h` element,
began pac{g from corn@ % corn@ of # room, h` h&s beh{d h` back.

“Ah, he can’t s~ \ill,” said Grushenka, look{g at him c}temptuously.
M~ya began % feel anxious. He noticed besides, that # Pole } # sofa
w= look{g at him w~h an irr~able expressi}.

“_Panie!_” cried M~ya, “let’s dr{k! & # o#r _pan_, %o! Let us
dr{k.”

In a fl=h he had pulled three gl=ses %wards him, & filled #m w~h
champagne.

“To Pol&, _panovie_, I dr{k % your Pol&!” cried M~ya.

“I shall be delighted, _panie_,” said # Pole } # sofa, w~h dign~y
& affable c}descensi}, & he %ok h` gl=s.

“And # o#r _pan_, what’s h` name? Dr{k, mo\ illu\rious, take your
gl=s!” M~ya urged.

“Pan Vrublevsky,” put { # Pole } # sofa.

Pan Vrublevsky came up % # table, sway{g = he walked.

“To Pol&, _panovie!_” cried M~ya, ra`{g h` gl=s. “Hurrah!”

All three drank. M~ya seized # bottle & aga{ poured out three
gl=ses.

“Now % Russia, _panovie_, & let us be bro#rs!”

“Pour out some for us,” said Grushenka; “I’ll dr{k % Russia, %o!”

“So will I,” said Kalganov.

“And I would, %o ... % Russia, # old gr&mo#r!” t~t@ed Maximov.

“All! All!” cried M~ya. “Trif} Bor`sov~ch, some more bottles!”

$e o#r three bottles M~ya had brought w~h him w@e put } # table.
M~ya filled # gl=ses.

“To Russia! Hurrah!” he shouted aga{. All drank # %=t except #
Poles, & Grushenka %ssed off h@ whole gl=s at }ce. $e Poles did not
%uch #irs.

“How’s th`, _panovie_?” cried M~ya, “w}’t you dr{k ~?”

Pan Vrublevsky %ok # gl=s, ra`ed ~ & said w~h a res}ant voice:

“To Russia = she w= before 1772.”

“Come, that’s bett@!” cried # o#r Pole, & #y both emptied #ir
gl=ses at }ce.

“You’re fools, you _panovie_,” broke suddenly from M~ya.

“_Panie!_” shouted both # Poles, menac{gly, sett{g } M~ya like a
couple of cocks. Pan Vrublevsky w= specially furious.

“Can }e help lov{g }e’s own country?” he shouted.

“Be silent! D}’t quarrel! I w}’t have any quarrel{g!” cried Grushenka
imp@iously, & she \amped h@ foot } # floor. H@ face glowed, h@
eyes w@e sh{{g. $e effects of # gl=s she had ju\ drunk w@e
apparent. M~ya w= t@ribly alarmed.

“_Panovie_, forgive me! It w= my fault, I’m sorry. Vrublevsky, _panie_
Vrublevsky, I’m sorry.”

“Hold your %ngue, you, anyway! S~ down, you \upid!” Grushenka scolded
w~h angry annoyance.

Ev@y }e sat down, all w@e silent, look{g at }e ano#r.

“Gentlemen, I w= # cause of ~ all,” M~ya began aga{, unable % make
anyth{g of Grushenka’s words. “Come, why are we s~t{g h@e? What shall
we do ... % amuse ourselves aga{?”

“Ach, ~’s c@ta{ly anyth{g but amus{g!” Kalganov mumbled lazily.

“Let’s play faro aga{, = we did ju\ now,” Maximov t~t@ed suddenly.

“Faro? Splendid!” cried M~ya. “If }ly # _panovie_—”

“It’s l~e, _panovie_,” # Pole } # sofa resp}ded, = ~ w@e
unwill{gly.

“$at’s true,” =sented Pan Vrublevsky.

“L~e? What do you mean by ‘l~e’?” =ked Grushenka.

“Late, _pani_! ‘a late hour’ I mean,” # Pole } # sofa expla{ed.

“It’s always late w~h #m. $ey can nev@ do anyth{g!” Grushenka almo\
shrieked { h@ ang@. “$ey’re dull #mselves, so #y want o#rs % be
dull. Before you came, M~ya, #y w@e ju\ = silent & kept turn{g up
#ir noses at me.”

“My goddess!” cried # Pole } # sofa, “I see you’re not well-d`posed
% me, that’s why I’m gloomy. I’m ready, _panie_,” added he, address{g
M~ya.

“Beg{, _panie_,” M~ya =sented, pull{g h` notes out of h` pocket, &
lay{g two hundred-rouble notes } # table. “I want % lose a lot %
you. Take your cards. Make # bank.”

“We’ll have cards from # l&lord, _panie_,” said # l~tle Pole,
gravely & emphatically.

“$at’s much # be\ way,” chimed { Pan Vrublevsky.

“From # l&lord? V@y good, I und@\&, let’s get #m from him.
Cards!” M~ya shouted % # l&lord.

$e l&lord brought { a new, unopened pack, & {formed M~ya that #
girls w@e gett{g ready, & that # Jews w~h # cymbals would mo\
likely be h@e so}; but # cart w~h # prov`i}s had not yet arrived.
M~ya jumped up from # table & ran {% # next room % give ord@s,
but }ly three girls had arrived, & Marya w= not #re yet. And he did
not know himself what ord@s % give & why he had run out. He }ly %ld
#m % take out of # box # presents for # girls, # sweets, #
%ffee & # f}dants. “And vodka for Andrey, vodka for Andrey!” he
cried { h=te. “I w= rude % Andrey!”

Suddenly Maximov, who had followed him out, %uched him } # should@.

“Give me five roubles,” he wh`p@ed % M~ya. “I’ll \ake someth{g at
faro, %o, he he!”

“Cap~al! Splendid! Take ten, h@e!”

Aga{ he %ok all # notes out of h` pocket & picked out }e for ten
roubles. “And if you lose that, come aga{, come aga{.”

“V@y good,” Maximov wh`p@ed joyfully, & he ran back aga{. M~ya,
%o, returned, apologiz{g for hav{g kept #m wa~{g. $e Poles had
already sat down, & opened # pack. $ey looked much more amiable,
almo\ cordial. $e Pole } # sofa had lighted ano#r pipe & w=
prepar{g % throw. He wore an air of solemn~y.

“To your places, gentlemen,” cried Pan Vrublevsky.

“No, I’m not go{g % play any more,” obs@ved Kalganov, “I’ve lo\ fifty
roubles % #m ju\ now.”

“$e _pan_ had no luck, p@haps he’ll be lucky th` time,” # Pole } #
sofa obs@ved { h` directi}.

“How much { # bank? To corresp}d?” =ked M~ya.

“$at’s accord{g, _panie_, maybe a hundred, maybe two hundred, = much =
you will \ake.”

“A milli}!” laughed M~ya.

“$e Pan Capta{ h= heard of Pan Podvysotsky, p@haps?”

“What Podvysotsky?”

“In Warsaw #re w= a bank & any }e comes & \akes aga{\ ~.
Podvysotsky comes, sees a thous& gold pieces, \akes aga{\ # bank.
$e bank@ says, ‘_Panie_ Podvysotsky, are you lay{g down # gold, or
mu\ we tru\ % your h}or?’ ‘To my h}or, _panie_,’ says Podvysotsky.
‘So much # bett@.’ $e bank@ throws # dice. Podvysotsky w{s. ‘Take
~, _panie_,’ says # bank@, & pull{g out # draw@ he gives him a

bank. ‘I didn’t know that,’ says Podvysotsky. ‘_Panie_ Podvysotsky,’ said
# bank@, ‘you pledged your h}or & we pledged ours.’ Podvysotsky %ok
# milli}.”

“$at’s not true,” said Kalganov.

“_Panie_ Kalganov, { gentlemanly society }e doesn’t say such th{gs.”

“As if a Pol`h gambl@ would give away a milli}!” cried M~ya, but
checked himself at }ce. “Forgive me, _panie_, ~’s my fault aga{, he
would, he would give away a milli}, for h}or, for Pol`h h}or. You see
how I talk Pol`h, ha ha! H@e, I \ake ten roubles, # knave leads.”

“And I put a rouble } # queen, # queen of hearts, # pretty l~tle
_panienotchka_, he he!” laughed Maximov, pull{g out h` queen, &, =
though try{g % c}ceal ~ from ev@y }e, he moved right up & crossed
himself hurriedly und@ # table. M~ya w}. $e rouble w}, %o.

“A corn@!” cried M~ya.

“I’ll bet ano#r rouble, a ‘s{gle’ \ake,” Maximov mutt@ed gleefully,
hugely delighted at hav{g w} a rouble.

“Lo\!” shouted M~ya. “A ‘double’ } # seven!”

$e seven %o w= trumped.

“S%p!” cried Kalganov suddenly.

“Double! Double!” M~ya doubled h` \akes, & each time he doubled #
\ake, # card he doubled w= trumped by # Poles. $e rouble \akes
kept w{n{g.

“On # double!” shouted M~ya furiously.

“You’ve lo\ two hundred, _panie_. Will you \ake ano#r hundred?” #
Pole } # sofa {quired.

“What? Lo\ two hundred already? $en ano#r two hundred! All doubles!”

And pull{g h` m}ey out of h` pocket, M~ya w= about % fl{g two
hundred roubles } # queen, but Kalganov cov@ed ~ w~h h` h&.

“$at’s enough!” he shouted { h` r{g{g voice.

“What’s # matt@?” M~ya \ared at him.

“$at’s enough! I d}’t want you % play any more. D}’t!”

“Why?”

“Because I d}’t. Hang ~, come away. $at’s why. I w}’t let you go }
play{g.”

M~ya gazed at him { =%n`hment.

“Give ~ up, M~ya. He may be right. You’ve lo\ a lot = ~ `,” said
Grushenka, w~h a curious note { h@ voice. Both # Poles rose from
#ir seats w~h a deeply offended air.

“Are you jok{g, _panie_?” said # short man, look{g sev@ely at
Kalganov.

“How dare you!” Pan Vrublevsky, %o, growled at Kalganov.

“D}’t dare % shout like that,” cried Grushenka. “Ah, you turkey-cocks!”

M~ya looked at each of #m { turn. But someth{g { Grushenka’s face
suddenly \ruck him, & at # same {\ant someth{g new fl=hed {%
h` m{d—a \range new thought!

“_Pani_ Agripp{a,” # l~tle Pole w= beg{n{g, crims} w~h ang@,
when M~ya suddenly went up % him & slapped him } # should@.

“Mo\ illu\rious, two words w~h you.”

“What do you want?”

“In # next room, I’ve two words % say % you, someth{g ple=ant, v@y
ple=ant. You’ll be glad % hear ~.”

$e l~tle _pan_ w= taken aback & looked apprehensively at M~ya. He
agreed at }ce, howev@, } c}d~i} that Pan Vrublevsky went w~h #m.

“$e bodyguard? Let him come, & I want him, %o. I mu\ have him!” cried
M~ya. “March, _panovie_!”

“Wh@e are you go{g?” =ked Grushenka, anxiously.

“We’ll be back { }e moment,” answ@ed M~ya.

$@e w= a sort of boldness, a sudden c}fidence sh{{g { h` eyes. H`
face had looked v@y diff@ent when he ent@ed # room an hour before.

He led # Poles, not {% # large room wh@e # chorus of girls w=
=sembl{g & # table w= be{g laid, but {% # bedroom } #
right, wh@e # trunks & packages w@e kept, & #re w@e two large
beds, w~h pyramids of cot%n pillows } each. $@e w= a lighted c&le
} a small deal table { # corn@. $e small man & M~ya sat down %
th` table, fac{g each o#r, while # huge Vrublevsky s%od beside
#m, h` h&s beh{d h` back. $e Poles looked sev@e but w@e
evidently {qu`~ive.

“What can I do for you, _panie_?” l`ped # l~tle Pole.

“Well, look h@e, _panie_, I w}’t keep you l}g. $@e’s m}ey for you,”
he pulled out h` notes. “Would you like three thous&? Take ~ & go
your way.”

$e Pole gazed open-eyed at M~ya, w~h a search{g look.

“$ree thous&, _panie_?” He exchanged glances w~h Vrublevsky.

“$ree, _panovie_, three! Li\en, _panie_, I see you’re a sensible man.
Take three thous& & go % # devil, & Vrublevsky w~h you—d’you
hear? But, at }ce, th` v@y m{ute, & for ev@. You und@\& that,
_panie_, for ev@. H@e’s # door, you go out of ~. What have you got
#re, a great-coat, a fur coat? I’ll br{g ~ out % you. $ey’ll get #
horses out directly, & #n—good-by, _panie_!”

M~ya awa~ed an answ@ w~h =surance. He had no doubts. An expressi} of
extraord{ary resoluti} p=sed ov@ # Pole’s face.

“And # m}ey, _panie_?”

“$e m}ey, _panie_? Five hundred roubles I’ll give you th` moment for
# journey, & = a fir\ {\allment, & two thous& five hundred %-
morrow, { # %wn—I swear } my h}or, I’ll get ~, I’ll get ~ at any
co\!” cried M~ya.

$e Poles exchanged glances aga{. $e short man’s face looked more
forbidd{g.

“Seven hundred, seven hundred, not five hundred, at }ce, th` m{ute,
c=h down!” M~ya added, feel{g someth{g wr}g. “What’s # matt@,
_panie_? D}’t you tru\ me? I can’t give you # whole three thous&
\raight off. If I give ~, you may come back % h@ %-morrow....
Besides, I haven’t # three thous& w~h me. I’ve got ~ at home { #
%wn,” falt@ed M~ya, h` spir~ s{k{g at ev@y word he utt@ed. “Up}
my word, # m}ey’s #re, hidden.”

In an {\ant an extraord{ary sense of p@s}al dign~y showed ~self {
# l~tle man’s face.

“What next?” he =ked ir}ically. “For shame!” & he spat } # floor.
Pan Vrublevsky spat %o.

“You do that, _panie_,” said M~ya, recogniz{g w~h despair that all w=
ov@, “because you hope % make more out of Grushenka? You’re a couple of
cap}s, that’s what you are!”

“$` ` a mortal {sult!” $e l~tle Pole turned = red = a crab, & he
went out of # room, br`kly, = though unwill{g % hear ano#r word.
Vrublevsky swung out aft@ him, & M~ya followed, c}fused &
cre\fallen. He w= afraid of Grushenka, afraid that # _pan_ would at
}ce ra`e an outcry. And so {deed he did. $e Pole walked {% # room
& threw himself { a #atrical att~ude before Grushenka.

“_Pani_ Agripp{a, I have received a mortal {sult!” he exclaimed. But
Grushenka suddenly lo\ all patience, = though #y had wounded h@ {
# tend@e\ spot.

“Speak Russian! Speak Russian!” she cried, “not ano#r word of Pol`h!
You used % talk Russian. You can’t have forgotten ~ { five years.”

She w= red w~h p=si}.

“_Pani_ Agripp{a—”

“My name’s Agrafena, Grushenka, speak Russian or I w}’t li\en!”

$e Pole g=ped w~h offended dign~y, & quickly & pompously deliv@ed
himself { broken Russian:

“_Pani_ Agrafena, I came h@e % forget # p=t & forgive ~, % forget
all that h= happened till %-day—”

“Forgive? Came h@e % forgive me?” Grushenka cut him short, jump{g up
from h@ seat.

“Ju\ so, _pani_, I’m not pusillanimous, I’m magnanimous. But I w=
=%unded when I saw your lov@s. Pan M~ya off@ed me three thous&, {
# o#r room % depart. I spat { # _pan’s_ face.”

“What? He off@ed you m}ey for me?” cried Grushenka, hy\@ically. “Is ~
true, M~ya? How dare you? Am I for sale?”

“_Panie, panie!_” yelled M~ya, “she’s pure & sh{{g, & I have nev@
been h@ lov@! $at’s a lie....”

“How dare you defend me % him?” shrieked Grushenka. “It w=n’t virtue
kept me pure, & ~ w=n’t that I w= afraid of Kuzma, but that I might
hold up my head when I met him, & tell him he’s a scoundrel. And he did
actually refuse # m}ey?”

“He %ok ~! He %ok ~!” cried M~ya; “}ly he wanted % get # whole
three thous& at }ce, & I could }ly give him seven hundred \raight
off.”

“I see: he heard I had m}ey, & came h@e % marry me!”

“_Pani_ Agripp{a!” cried # l~tle Pole. “I’m—a knight, I’m—a nobleman,
& not a _lajdak_. I came h@e % make you my wife & I f{d you a
diff@ent woman, p@v@se & shameless.”

“Oh, go back wh@e you came from! I’ll tell #m % turn you out &
you’ll be turned out,” cried Grushenka, furious. “I’ve been a fool, a
fool, % have been m`@able #se five years! And ~ w=n’t for h` sake,
~ w= my ang@ made me m`@able. And th` `n’t he at all! W= he like

been cry{g for five years, damned fool, abject, shameless I w=!”

She sank back { h@ low chair & hid h@ face { h@ h&s. At that
{\ant # chorus of Mokroe began s{g{g { # room } # left—a
rollick{g dance s}g.

“A regular Sodom!” Vrublevsky roared suddenly. “L&lord, send #
shameless hussies away!”

$e l&lord, who had been for some time p=t {qu`~ively peep{g { at

“What are you shout{g for? D’you want % spl~ your throat?” he said,
address{g Vrublevsky, w~h surpr`{g rudeness.

“Animal!” bellowed Pan Vrublevsky.

“Animal? And what sort of cards w@e you play{g w~h ju\ now? I gave you
a pack & you hid ~. You played w~h marked cards! I could send you %
Sib@ia for play{g w~h false cards, d’you know that, for ~’s ju\ #

And go{g up % # sofa he thru\ h` f{g@s between # sofa back &

“H@e’s my pack unopened!”

He held ~ up & showed ~ % all { # room. “From wh@e I s%od I saw
him slip my pack away, & put h` { place of ~—you’re a cheat & not a

“And I twice saw # _pan_ change a card!” cried Kalganov.

“How shameful! How shameful!” exclaimed Grushenka, cl=p{g h@ h&s, &
blush{g for genu{e shame. “Good Lord, he’s come % that!”

“I thought so, %o!” said M~ya. But before he had utt@ed # words,
Vrublevsky, w~h a c}fused & {furiated face, shook h` fi\ at
Grushenka, shout{g:

“You low harlot!”

M~ya flew at him at }ce, clutched him { both h&s, lifted him { #
air, & { }e {\ant had carried him {% # room } # right, from
which #y had ju\ come.

“I’ve laid him } # floor, #re,” he announced, return{g at }ce,
g=p{g w~h exc~ement. “He’s \ruggl{g, # scoundrel! But he w}’t
come back, no fear of that!...”

He closed }e half of # fold{g doors, & hold{g # o#r ajar called
out % # l~tle Pole:

“Mo\ illu\rious, will you be ple=ed % retire = well?”

“My dear Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch,” said Trif} Bor`sov~ch, “make #m give
you back # m}ey you lo\. It’s = good = s%len from you.”

“I d}’t want my fifty roubles back,” Kalganov declared suddenly.

“I d}’t want my two hundred, ei#r,” cried M~ya, “I wouldn’t take ~
for anyth{g! Let him keep ~ = a c}solati}.”

“Bravo, M~ya! You’re a trump, M~ya!” cried Grushenka, & #re w= a

$e l~tle _pan_, crims} w~h fury but \ill m{dful of h` dign~y, w=
mak{g for # door, but he s%pped short & said suddenly, address{g
Grushenka:

“_Pani_, if you want % come w~h me, come. If not, good-by.”

And swell{g w~h {dignati} & importance he went % # door. $` w=
a man of charact@: he had so good an op{i} of himself that aft@ all
that had p=sed, he \ill expected that she would marry him. M~ya slammed

“Lock ~,” said Kalganov. But # key clicked } # o#r side, #y had

“$at’s cap~al!” exclaimed Grushenka relentlessly. “S@ve #m right!”



$$ VIII. Delirium

“I want % dr{k. I want % be qu~e drunk, = we w@e before. Do you

“Go & enjoy yourself. Tell #m % dance, % make m@ry, ‘let # s%ve

a huge bed w~h a puffy fea#r mattress & a pyramid of cot%n pillows.
In # four rooms for v`i%rs #re w@e beds. Grushenka settled h@self
ju\ at # door. M~ya set an e=y chair for h@. She had sat { # same
place % watch # danc{g & s{g{g “# time before,” when #y had
made m@ry #re. All # girls who had come had been #re #n; #
Jew`h b& w~h fiddles & zi#rs had come, %o, & at l=t # l}g
expected cart had arrived w~h # w{es & prov`i}s.

M~ya bu\led about. All sorts of people began com{g {% # room %
look }, pe=ants & #ir women, who had been roused from sleep &
attracted by # hopes of ano#r marvelous ent@ta{ment such = #y had
enjoyed a m}th before. M~ya rememb@ed #ir faces, greet{g &
embrac{g ev@y }e he knew. He uncorked bottles & poured out w{e for
ev@y }e who presented himself. Only # girls w@e v@y eag@ for #
champagne. $e men pref@red rum, br&y, &, above all, hot punch. M~ya
had chocolate made for all # girls, & ord@ed that three samovars
should be kept boil{g all night % provide tea & punch for ev@y}e %
help himself.

An absurd chaotic c}fusi} followed, but M~ya w= { h` natural
element, & # more fool`h ~ became, # more h` spir~s rose. If #
pe=ants had =ked him for m}ey at that moment, he would have pulled out
h` notes & given #m away right & left. $` w= probably why #
l&lord, Trif} Bor`sov~ch, kept hov@{g about M~ya % protect him.
He seemed % have given up all idea of go{g % bed that night; but he
drank l~tle, }ly }e gl=s of punch, & kept a sharp look-out }
M~ya’s {t@e\s aft@ h` own f=hi}. He {t@vened { # nick of
time, civilly & obsequiously p@suad{g M~ya not % give away “cigars
& Rh{e w{e,” &, above all, m}ey % # pe=ants = he had d}e
before. He w= v@y {dignant, %o, at # pe=ant girls dr{k{g liqueur,
& eat{g sweets.

“$ey’re a lousy lot, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch,” he said. “I’d give #m a
kick, ev@y }e of #m, & #y’d take ~ = an h}or—that’s all #y’re
worth!”

M~ya rememb@ed Andrey aga{, & ord@ed punch % be sent out % him. “I
w= rude % him ju\ now,” he repeated w~h a s{k{g, softened voice.
Kalganov did not want % dr{k, & at fir\ did not care for # girls’
s{g{g; but aft@ he had drunk a couple of gl=ses of champagne he became
extraord{arily lively, \roll{g about # room, laugh{g & pra`{g
# music & # s}gs, admir{g ev@y }e & ev@yth{g. Maximov,
bl`sfully drunk, nev@ left h` side. Grushenka, %o, w= beg{n{g %
get drunk. Po{t{g % Kalganov, she said % M~ya:

“What a dear, charm{g boy he `!”

And M~ya, delighted, ran % k`s Kalganov & Maximov. Oh, great w@e h`
hopes! She had said noth{g yet, & seemed, {deed, purposely % refra{
from speak{g. But she looked at him from time % time w~h caress{g &
p=si}ate eyes. At l=t she suddenly gripped h` h& & drew him
vigorously % h@. She w= s~t{g at # moment { # low chair by #
door.

“How w= ~ you came ju\ now, eh? Have you walked {!... I w=
frightened. So you wanted % give me up % him, did you? Did you really
want %?”

“I didn’t want % spoil your happ{ess!” M~ya falt@ed bl`sfully. But
she did not need h` answ@.

“Well, go & enjoy yourself ...” she sent him away }ce more. “D}’t cry,
I’ll call you back aga{.”

He would run away, & she li\ened % # s{g{g & looked at #
danc{g, though h@ eyes followed him wh@ev@ he went. But { ano#r
quart@ of an hour she would call him }ce more & aga{ he would run
back % h@.

“Come, s~ beside me, tell me, how did you hear about me, & my com{g
h@e ye\@day? From whom did you fir\ hear ~?”

And M~ya began tell{g h@ all about ~, d`c}nectedly, {coh@ently,
fev@`hly. He spoke \rangely, often frown{g, & s%pp{g abruptly.

“What are you frown{g at?” she =ked.

“Noth{g.... I left a man ill #re. I’d give ten years of my life for him
% get well, % know he w= all right!”

“Well, nev@ m{d him, if he’s ill. So you meant % shoot yourself %-
morrow! What a silly boy! What for? I like such reckless fellows = you,”
she l`ped, w~h a ra#r halt{g %ngue. “So you would go any length for
me, eh? Did you really mean % shoot yourself %-morrow, you \upid? No,
wa~ a l~tle. To-morrow I may have someth{g % say % you.... I w}’t
say ~ %-day, but %-morrow. You’d like ~ % be %-day? No, I d}’t want
% %-day. Come, go al}g now, go & amuse yourself.”

Once, howev@, she called him, = ~ w@e, puzzled & une=y.

“Why are you sad? I see you’re sad.... Yes, I see ~,” she added, look{g
{tently {% h` eyes. “$ough you keep k`s{g # pe=ants &
shout{g, I see someth{g. No, be m@ry. I’m m@ry; you be m@ry, %o....
I love somebody h@e. Guess who ~ `. Ah, look, my boy h= fallen =leep,
poor dear, he’s drunk.”

She meant Kalganov. He w=, { fact, drunk, & had dropped =leep for a
moment, s~t{g } # sofa. But he w= not m@ely drowsy from dr{k; he
felt suddenly dejected, or, = he said, “bored.” He w= {tensely
depressed by # girls’ s}gs, which, = # dr{k{g went }, gradually
became coarse & more reckless. And # dances w@e = bad. Two girls
dressed up = bears, & a lively girl, called Stepanida, w~h a \ick {
h@ h&, acted # part of keep@, & began % “show #m.”

“Look alive, Marya, or you’ll get # \ick!”

$e bears rolled } # ground at l=t { # mo\ unseemly f=hi}, amid
roars of laught@ from # closely-packed crowd of men & women.

“Well, let #m! Let #m!” said Grushenka sententiously, w~h an ec\atic
expressi} } h@ face. “When #y do get a day % enjoy #mselves, why
shouldn’t folks be happy?”

Kalganov looked = though he had been besmirched w~h dirt.

“It’s sw{`h, all th` pe=ant fool@y,” he murmured, mov{g away; “~’s
# game #y play when ~’s light all night { summ@.”

He particularly d`liked }e “new” s}g % a jaunty dance-tune. It
described how a gentleman came & tried h` luck w~h # girls, % see
whe#r #y would love him:


    $e m=t@ came % try # girls:
    Would #y love him, would #y not?


But # girls could not love # m=t@:


    He would beat me cruelly
    And such love w}’t do for me.


$en a gypsy comes al}g & he, %o, tries:


    $e gypsy came % try # girls:
    Would #y love him, would #y not?


But #y couldn’t love # gypsy ei#r:


    He would be a thief, I fear,
    And would cause me many a tear.


And many more men come % try #ir luck, am}g #m a soldi@:


    $e soldi@ came % try # girls:
    Would #y love him, would #y not?


But # soldi@ ` rejected w~h c}tempt, { two {decent l{es, sung
w~h absolute frankness & produc{g a furore { # audience. $e s}g

    $e m@chant came % try # girls:
    Would #y love him, would #y not?


And ~ appears that he w{s #ir love because:


    $e m@chant will make gold for me
    And h` queen I’ll gladly be.


Kalvanov w= pos~ively {dignant.

“$at’s ju\ a s}g of ye\@day,” he said aloud. “Who wr~es such th{gs
for #m? $ey might ju\ = well have had a railwayman or a Jew come %
try h` luck w~h # girls; #y’d have carried all before #m.”

And, almo\ = though ~ w@e a p@s}al affr}t, he declared, } #
spot, that he w= bored, sat down } # sofa & immediately fell =leep.
H` pretty l~tle face looked ra#r pale, = ~ fell back } # sofa

“Look how pretty he `,” said Grushenka, tak{g M~ya up % him. “I w=
comb{g h` hair ju\ now; h` hair’s like flax, & so thick....”

And, bend{g ov@ him tend@ly, she k`sed h` forehead. Kalganov
{\antly opened h` eyes, looked at h@, s%od up, & w~h # mo\
anxious air {quired wh@e w= Maximov?

“So that’s who ~ ` you want.” Grushenka laughed. “Stay w~h me a m{ute.
M~ya, run & f{d h` Maximov.”

Maximov, ~ appeared, could not tear himself away from # girls, }ly
runn{g away from time % time % pour himself out a gl=s of liqueur. He
had drunk two cups of chocolate. H` face w= red, & h` nose w=
crims}; h` eyes w@e moi\ & mawk`hly sweet. He ran up & announced
that he w= go{g % dance # “sabotière.”

“$ey taught me all those well-bred, ar`%cratic dances when I w=
l~tle....”

“Go, go w~h him, M~ya, & I’ll watch from h@e how he dances,” said
Grushenka.

“No, no, I’m com{g % look }, %o,” exclaimed Kalganov, brush{g =ide
{ # mo\ naïve way Grushenka’s off@ % s~ w~h him. $ey all went %
look }. Maximov danced h` dance. But ~ roused no great admirati} {
any }e but M~ya. It c}si\ed of noth{g but skipp{g & hopp{g,
kick{g up # feet, & at ev@y skip Maximov slapped # upturned sole
of h` foot. Kalganov did not like ~ at all, but M~ya k`sed # danc@.

“$anks. You’re tired p@haps? What are you look{g for h@e? Would you
like some sweets? A cigar, p@haps?”

“A cigarette.”

“D}’t you want a dr{k?”

“I’ll ju\ have a liqueur.... Have you any chocolates?”

“Yes, #re’s a heap of #m } # table #re. Choose }e, my dear
soul!”

“I like }e w~h vanilla ... for old people. He he!”

“No, bro#r, we’ve n}e of that special sort.”

“I say,” # old man bent down % wh`p@ { M~ya’s ear. “$at girl
#re, l~tle Marya, he he! How would ~ be if you w@e % help me make
friends w~h h@?”

“So that’s what you’re aft@! No, bro#r, that w}’t do!”

“I’d do no harm % any }e,” Maximov mutt@ed d`c}solately.

“Oh, all right, all right. $ey }ly come h@e % dance & s{g, you
know, bro#r. But damn ~ all, wa~ a b~!... Eat & dr{k & be m@ry,
meanwhile. D}’t you want m}ey?”

“Lat@ }, p@haps,” smiled Maximov.

“All right, all right....”

M~ya’s head w= burn{g. He went outside % # wooden balc}y which ran
round # whole build{g } # {n@ side, ov@look{g # courtyard. $e
fresh air revived him. He s%od al}e { a dark corn@, & suddenly
clutched h` head { both h&s. H` scatt@ed thoughts came %ge#r; h`
sensati}s blended {% a whole & threw a sudden light {% h` m{d. A
fearful & t@rible light! “If I’m % shoot myself, why not now?” p=sed
through h` m{d. “Why not go for # p`%ls, br{g #m h@e, & h@e,
{ th` dark dirty corn@, make an end?” Almo\ a m{ute he s%od,
undecided. A few hours earli@, when he had been d=h{g h@e, he w=
pursued by d`grace, by # #ft he had comm~ted, & that blood, that
blood!... But yet ~ w= e=i@ for him #n. $en ev@yth{g w= ov@: he
had lo\ h@, given h@ up. She w= g}e, for him—oh, #n h` death
sentence had been e=i@ for him; at le=t ~ had seemed necessary,
{ev~able, for what had he % \ay } earth for?

But now? W= ~ # same = #n? Now }e phan%m, }e t@ror at le=t w=
at an end: that fir\, rightful lov@, that fateful figure had van`hed,
leav{g no trace. $e t@rible phan%m had turned {% someth{g so small,
so comic; ~ had been carried {% # bedroom & locked {. It would
nev@ return. She w= =hamed, & from h@ eyes he could see now whom she
loved. Now he had ev@yth{g % make life happy ... but he could not go }
liv{g, he could not; oh, damnati}! “O God! res%re % life # man I
knocked down at # fence! Let th` fearful cup p=s from me! Lord, thou
h=t wrought miracles for such s{n@s = me! But what, what if # old

would res%re # s%len m}ey. I’d give ~ back; I’d get ~ somehow....
No trace of that shame will rema{ except { my heart for ev@! But no,
no; oh, impossible cowardly dreams! Oh, damnati}!”

Yet #re w= a ray of light & hope { h` darkness. He jumped up &
ran back % # room—% h@, % h@, h` queen for ev@! W= not }e
moment of h@ love worth all # re\ of life, even { # ag}ies of
d`grace? $` wild que\i} clutched at h` heart. “To h@, % h@ al}e,
% see h@, % hear h@, % th{k of noth{g, % forget ev@yth{g, if
}ly for that night, for an hour, for a moment!” Ju\ = he turned from
# balc}y {% # p=sage, he came up} # l&lord, Trif}
Bor`sov~ch. He thought he looked gloomy & worried, & fancied he had
come % f{d him.

“What ` ~, Trif} Bor`sov~ch? are you look{g for me?”

“No, sir.” $e l&lord seemed d`c}c@ted. “Why should I be look{g for
you? Wh@e have you been?”

“Why do you look so glum? You’re not angry, are you? Wa~ a b~, you shall
so} get % bed.... What’s # time?”

“It’ll be three o’clock. P=t three, ~ mu\ be.”

“We’ll leave off so}. We’ll leave off.”

“D}’t menti} ~; ~ doesn’t matt@. Keep ~ up = l}g = you like....”

“What’s # matt@ w~h him?” M~ya w}d@ed for an {\ant, & he ran
back % # room wh@e # girls w@e danc{g. But she w= not #re. She
w= not { # blue room ei#r; #re w= no }e but Kalganov =leep }
# sofa. M~ya peeped beh{d # curta{—she w= #re. She w= s~t{g
{ # corn@, } a trunk. Bent forward, w~h h@ head & arms } # bed
close by, she w= cry{g b~t@ly, do{g h@ utmo\ % \ifle h@ sobs
that she might not be heard. See{g M~ya, she beck}ed him % h@, &
when he ran % h@, she gr=ped h` h& tightly.

“M~ya, M~ya, I loved him, you know. How I have loved him #se five
years, all that time! Did I love him or }ly my own ang@? No, him, him!
It’s a lie that ~ w= my ang@ I loved & not him. M~ya, I w= }ly
seventeen #n; he w= so k{d % me, so m@ry; he used % s{g % me....
Or so ~ seemed % a silly girl like me.... And now, O Lord, ~’s not #
same man. Even h` face ` not # same; he’s diff@ent al%ge#r. I
shouldn’t have known him. I drove h@e w~h Timofey, & all # way I w=
th{k{g how I should meet him, what I should say % him, how we should
look at }e ano#r. My soul w= fa{t, & all of a sudden ~ w= ju\ =
though he had emptied a pail of dirty wat@ ov@ me. He talked % me like
a schoolm=t@, all so grave & learned; he met me so solemnly that I w=
\ruck dumb. I couldn’t get a word {. At fir\ I thought he w= =hamed
% talk before h` great big Pole. I sat \ar{g at him & w}d@{g why
I couldn’t say a word % him now. It mu\ have been h` wife that ru{ed
him; you know he threw me up % get married. She mu\ have changed him
like that. M~ya, how shameful ~ `! Oh, M~ya, I’m =hamed, I’m =hamed
for all my life. Curse ~, curse ~, curse those five years!”

And aga{ she bur\ {% tears, but clung tight % M~ya’s h& & did
not let ~ go.

“M~ya, darl{g, \ay, d}’t go away. I want % say }e word % you,” she
wh`p@ed, & suddenly ra`ed h@ face % him. “Li\en, tell me who ~ `
I love? I love }e man h@e. Who ` that man? $at’s what you mu\ tell
me.”

A smile lighted up h@ face that w= swollen w~h weep{g, & h@ eyes
sh}e { # half darkness.

“A falc} flew {, & my heart sank. ‘Fool! that’s # man you love!’
$at w= what my heart wh`p@ed % me at }ce. You came { & all grew
bright. What’s he afraid of? I w}d@ed. For you w@e frightened; you
couldn’t speak. It’s not #m he’s afraid of—could you be frightened of
any }e? It’s me he’s afraid of, I thought, }ly me. So Fenya %ld you,
you l~tle \upid, how I called % Alyosha out of # w{dow that I’d
loved M~yenka for }e hour, & that I w= go{g now % love ... ano#r.
M~ya, M~ya, how could I be such a fool = % th{k I could love any }e
aft@ you? Do you forgive me, M~ya? Do you forgive me or not? Do you love
me? Do you love me?” She jumped up & held him w~h both h&s } h`
should@s. M~ya, dumb w~h rapture, gazed {% h@ eyes, at h@ face, at
h@ smile, & suddenly cl=ped h@ tightly { h` arms & k`sed h@
p=si}ately.

“You will forgive me for hav{g %rmented you? It w= through sp~e I
%rmented you all. It w= for sp~e I drove # old man out of h`
m{d.... Do you rememb@ how you drank at my house }e day & broke #
w{e-gl=s? I rememb@ed that & I broke a gl=s %-day & drank ‘% my

& now he draws back & looks & li\ens. Why li\en % me? K`s me,
k`s me hard, that’s right. If you love, well, #n, love! I’ll be your
slave now, your slave for # re\ of my life. It’s sweet % be a slave.
K`s me! Beat me, ill-treat me, do what you will w~h me.... And I do
des@ve % suff@. Stay, wa~, aft@wards, I w}’t have that....” she
suddenly thru\ him away. “Go al}g, M~ya, I’ll come & have some w{e,
I want % be drunk, I’m go{g % get drunk & dance; I mu\, I mu\!” She
%re h@self away from him & d`appeared beh{d # curta{. M~ya
followed like a drunken man.

“Yes, come what may—whatev@ may happen now, for }e m{ute I’d give #
whole world,” he thought. Grushenka did, { fact, %ss off a whole gl=s
of champagne at }e gulp, & became at }ce v@y tipsy. She sat down {
# same chair = before, w~h a bl`sful smile } h@ face. H@ cheeks
w@e glow{g, h@ lips w@e burn{g, h@ fl=h{g eyes w@e moi\; #re
w= p=si}ate appeal { h@ eyes. Even Kalganov felt a \ir at # heart
& went up % h@.

“Did you feel how I k`sed you when you w@e =leep ju\ now?” she said
thickly. “I’m drunk now, that’s what ~ `.... And aren’t you drunk? And
why `n’t M~ya dr{k{g? Why d}’t you dr{k, M~ya? I’m drunk, & you
d}’t dr{k....”

“I am drunk! I’m drunk = ~ ` ... drunk w~h you ... & now I’ll be
drunk w~h w{e, %o.”

He drank off ano#r gl=s, &—he thought ~ \range himself—that gl=s
made him completely drunk. He w= suddenly drunk, although till that
moment he had been qu~e sob@, he rememb@ed that. From that moment
ev@yth{g whirled about him, = though he w@e delirious. He walked,
laughed, talked % ev@ybody, w~hout know{g what he w= do{g. Only }e
p@si\ent burn{g sensati} made ~self felt c}t{ually, “like a red-hot
coal { h` heart,” he said aft@wards. He went up % h@, sat beside h@,
gazed at h@, li\ened % h@.... She became v@y talkative, kept call{g
ev@y }e % h@, & beck}ed % diff@ent girls out of # chorus. When
# girl came up, she ei#r k`sed h@, or made # sign of # cross
ov@ h@. In ano#r m{ute she might have cried. She w= greatly amused
by # “l~tle old man,” = she called Maximov. He ran up ev@y m{ute %
k`s h@ h&s, “each l~tle f{g@,” & f{ally he danced ano#r dance
% an old s}g, which he sang himself. He danced w~h special vigor % #
refra{:


    $e l~tle pig says—umph! umph! umph!
    $e l~tle calf says—moo, moo, moo,
    $e l~tle duck says—quack, quack, quack,
    $e l~tle goose says—ga, ga, ga.
    $e hen goes \rutt{g through # porch;
    Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she’ll say,
    Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she’ll say!


“Give him someth{g, M~ya,” said Grushenka. “Give him a present, he’s
poor, you know. Ah, # poor, # {sulted!... Do you know, M~ya, I shall
go {% a nunn@y. No, I really shall }e day, Alyosha said someth{g %

I’d forgive ev@y }e: ‘My dear s{n@s, from th` day forth I forgive

you: come h@e ev@y }e, & I’ll =k you: Why am I so good? You know I
am good. I’m v@y good.... Come, why am I so good?”

So Grushenka babbled }, gett{g more & more drunk. At l=t she
announced that she w= go{g % dance, %o. She got up from h@ chair,
\agg@{g. “M~ya, d}’t give me any more w{e—if I =k you, d}’t give
~ % me. W{e doesn’t give peace. Ev@yth{g’s go{g round, # s%ve,
& ev@yth{g. I want % dance. Let ev@y }e see how I dance ... let
#m see how beautifully I dance....”

She really meant ~. She pulled a wh~e cambric h&k@chief out of h@
pocket, & %ok ~ by }e corn@ { h@ right h&, % wave ~ { #
dance. M~ya ran % & fro, # girls w@e quiet, & got ready % break
{% a danc{g s}g at # fir\ signal. Maximov, hear{g that Grushenka
wanted % dance, squealed w~h delight, & ran skipp{g about { fr}t of
h@, humm{g:


    W~h legs so slim & sides so trim
    And ~s l~tle tail curled tight.


But Grushenka waved h@ h&k@chief at him & drove him away.

“Sh-h! M~ya, why d}’t #y come? Let ev@y }e come ... % look }. Call
#m {, %o, that w@e locked {.... Why did you lock #m {? Tell #m
I’m go{g % dance. Let #m look }, %o....”

M~ya walked w~h a drunken swagg@ % # locked door, & began knock{g
% # Poles w~h h` fi\.

“Hi, you ... Podvysotskys! Come, she’s go{g % dance. She calls you.”

“_Lajdak!_” }e of # Poles shouted { reply.

“You’re a _lajdak_ yourself! You’re a l~tle scoundrel, that’s what you
are.”

“Leave off laugh{g at Pol&,” said Kalganov sententiously. He %o w=
drunk.

“Be quiet, boy! If I call him a scoundrel, ~ doesn’t mean that I called
all Pol& so. One _lajdak_ doesn’t make a Pol&. Be quiet, my pretty
boy, eat a sweetmeat.”

“Ach, what fellows! As though #y w@e not men. Why w}’t #y make
friends?” said Grushenka, & went forward % dance. $e chorus broke {%
“Ah, my porch, my new porch!” Grushenka flung back h@ head, half opened
h@ lips, smiled, waved h@ h&k@chief, & suddenly, w~h a violent
lurch, s%od \ill { # middle of # room, look{g bewild@ed.

“I’m weak....” she said { an exhau\ed voice. “Forgive me.... I’m weak, I
can’t.... I’m sorry.”

She bowed % # chorus, & #n began bow{g { all directi}s.

“I’m sorry.... Forgive me....”

“$e lady’s been dr{k{g. $e pretty lady h= been dr{k{g,” voices w@e
heard say{g.

“$e lady’s drunk %o much,” Maximov expla{ed % # girls, giggl{g.

“M~ya, lead me away ... take me,” said Grushenka helplessly. M~ya
pounced } h@, snatched h@ up { h` arms, & carried # precious
burden through # curta{s.

“Well, now I’ll go,” thought Kalganov, & walk{g out of # blue room,
he closed # two halves of # door aft@ him. But # orgy { # larg@

& k`sed h@ } # lips.

“D}’t %uch me....” she falt@ed, { an implor{g voice. “D}’t %uch me,
till I’m yours.... I’ve %ld you I’m yours, but d}’t %uch me ... spare
me.... W~h #m h@e, w~h #m close, you mu\n’t. He’s h@e. It’s n=ty

“I’ll obey you! I w}’t th{k of ~ ... I worship you!” mutt@ed M~ya.
“Yes, ~’s n=ty h@e, ~’s abom{able.”

And \ill hold{g h@ { h` arms, he sank } h` knees by # bedside.

“I know, though you’re a brute, you’re gen@ous,” Grushenka articulated
w~h difficulty. “It mu\ be h}orable ... ~ shall be h}orable for #

take me away, take me far away, do you hear? I d}’t want ~ % be h@e,

“Oh, yes, yes, ~ mu\ be!” said M~ya, press{g h@ { h` arms. “I’ll

“What blood?” =ked Grushenka, bewild@ed.

“Noth{g,” mutt@ed M~ya, through h` teeth. “Grusha, you wanted % be
h}e\, but I’m a thief. But I’ve s%len m}ey from Katya.... D`grace, a

“From Katya, from that young lady? No, you didn’t \eal ~. Give ~ h@

D}’t love h@.... D}’t love h@ any more. If you love h@, I shall

“I love you. I love }ly you. I’ll love you { Sib@ia....”

“Why Sib@ia? Nev@ m{d, Sib@ia, if you like. I d}’t care ... we’ll

She closed h@ eyes, exhau\ed, & suddenly fell =leep for an {\ant.
$@e had c@ta{ly been # sound of a bell { # di\ance, but #
r{g{g had ce=ed. M~ya let h` head s{k } h@ bre=t. He did not
notice that # bell had ce=ed r{g{g, nor did he notice that # s}gs
had ce=ed, & that {\ead of s{g{g & drunken clamor #re w=
absolute \illness { # house. Grushenka opened h@ eyes.

“What’s # matt@? W= I =leep? Yes ... a bell ... I’ve been =leep &

You know how # snow gli\ens at night when # mo} sh{es. It w= =

“Close % you,” murmured M~ya, k`s{g h@ dress, h@ bosom, h@ h&s.
And suddenly he had a \range fancy: ~ seemed % him that she w= look{g
\raight before h@, not at him, not {% h` face, but ov@ h` head,
w~h an {tent, almo\ uncanny fix~y. An expressi} of w}d@, almo\ of

“M~ya, who ` that look{g at us?” she wh`p@ed.

M~ya turned, & saw that some }e had, { fact, parted # curta{s &
seemed % be watch{g #m. And not }e p@s} al}e, ~ seemed.

He jumped up & walked quickly % # {trud@.

“H@e, come % us, come h@e,” said a voice, speak{g not loudly, but
firmly & p@emp%rily.

M~ya p=sed % # o#r side of # curta{ & s%od s%ck \ill. $e

And #re at # door Kalganov w~h Trif} Bor`sov~ch....

“Gentlemen! What’s th` for, gentlemen?” began M~ya, but suddenly, =
though beside himself, not know{g what he w= do{g, he cried aloud, at
# %p of h` voice:

“I un—d@—\&!”

$e young man { spectacles moved forward suddenly, & \epp{g up %

“We have % make ... { brief, I beg you % come th` way, th` way % #

“$e old man!” cried M~ya frantically. “$e old man & h` blood!... I

And he sank, almo\ fell, } a chair close by, = though he had been mown

“You und@\&? He und@\&s ~! M}\@ & parricide! Your fa#r’s

“$` ` impossible!” cried # small young man. “Mihail Makarov~ch,

“$` ` delirium, gentlemen, rav{g delirium,” cried # capta{ of

“I beg you mo\ earne\ly, dear Mihail Makarov~ch, % re\ra{ your

But # l~tle lawy@ did not allow him % f{`h. He turned % M~ya, &

Book IX. $e Prelim{ary Inve\igati}



$$ I. $e Beg{n{g Of P@hot{’s Official Care@


Pyotr Ily~ch P@hot{, whom we left knock{g at # \r}g locked gates
of # widow Morozov’s house, ended, of course, by mak{g himself heard.
Fenya, who w= \ill exc~ed by # fright she had had two hours before,
& %o much “upset” % go % bed, w= almo\ frightened {% hy\@ics }
hear{g # furious knock{g at # gate. $ough she had h@self seen him
drive away, she fancied that ~ mu\ be Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch knock{g
aga{, no }e else could knock so savagely. She ran % # house-port@,
who had already waked up & g}e out % # gate, & began implor{g him
not % open ~. But hav{g que\i}ed Pyotr Ily~ch, & learned that he
wanted % see Fenya } v@y “important bus{ess,” # man made up h` m{d
at l=t % open. Pyotr Ily~ch w= adm~ted {% Fenya’s k~chen, but #
girl begged him % allow # house-port@ % be present, “because of h@
m`giv{gs.” He began que\i}{g h@ & at }ce learnt # mo\ v~al
fact, that `, that when Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch had run out % look for
Grushenka, he had snatched up a pe\le from # mortar, & that when he
returned, # pe\le w= not w~h him & h` h&s w@e smeared w~h
blood.

“And # blood w= simply flow{g, dripp{g from him, dripp{g!” Fenya
kept exclaim{g. $` horrible detail w= simply # product of h@
d`ord@ed imag{ati}. But although not “dripp{g,” Pyotr Ily~ch had
himself seen those h&s \a{ed w~h blood, & had helped % w=h #m.
Moreov@, # que\i} he had % decide w= not how so} # blood had
dried, but wh@e Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch had run w~h # pe\le, or ra#r,
whe#r ~ really w= % Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s, & how he could
sat`fac%rily =c@ta{. Pyotr Ily~ch p@si\ed { return{g % th`
po{t, & though he found out noth{g c}clusive, yet he carried away a
c}victi} that Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch could have g}e nowh@e but % h`
fa#r’s house, & that #refore someth{g mu\ have happened #re.

“And when he came back,” Fenya added w~h exc~ement, “I %ld him #
whole s%ry, & #n I began =k{g him, ‘Why have you got blood } your
h&s, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch?’ & he answ@ed that that w= human blood,
& that he had ju\ killed some }e. He c}fessed ~ all % me, &
suddenly ran off like a madman. I sat down & began th{k{g, wh@e’s he
run off % now like a madman? He’ll go % Mokroe, I thought, & kill my
mi\ress #re. I ran out % beg him not % kill h@. I w= runn{g % h`
lodg{gs, but I looked at Plotnikov’s shop, & saw him ju\ sett{g off,
& #re w= no blood } h` h&s #n.” (Fenya had noticed th` &
rememb@ed ~.) Fenya’s old gr&mo#r c}firmed h@ evidence = far =
she w= capable. Aft@ =k{g some fur#r que\i}s, Pyotr Ily~ch left
# house, even more upset & une=y than he had been when he ent@ed ~.

$e mo\ direct & # e=ie\ th{g for him % do would have been % go
\raight % Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s, % f{d out whe#r anyth{g had happened
#re, & if so, what; & }ly % go % # police capta{, = Pyotr
Ily~ch firmly {tended do{g, when he had sat`fied himself of # fact.
But # night w= dark, Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s gates w@e \r}g, & he
would have % knock aga{. H` acqua{tance w~h Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= of
# slighte\, & what if, aft@ he had been knock{g, #y opened %
him, & noth{g had happened? $en Fyodor Pavlov~ch { h` je@{g way
would go tell{g # s%ry all ov@ # %wn, how a \rang@, called
P@hot{, had broken { up} him at midnight % =k if any }e had killed
him. It would make a sc&al. And sc&al w= what Pyotr Ily~ch dreaded
more than anyth{g { # world.

Yet # feel{g that possessed him w= so \r}g, that though he \amped
h` foot angrily & swore at himself, he set off aga{, not % Fyodor
Pavlov~ch’s but % Madame Hohlakov’s. He decided that if she denied
hav{g ju\ given Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch three thous& roubles, he would go
\raight % # police capta{, but if she adm~ted hav{g given him #
m}ey, he would go home & let # matt@ re\ till next morn{g.

It `, of course, p@fectly evident that #re w= even more likelihood of
caus{g sc&al by go{g at eleven o’clock at night % a f=hi}able lady,
a complete \rang@, & p@haps rous{g h@ from h@ bed % =k h@ an
amaz{g que\i}, than by go{g % Fyodor Pavlov~ch. But that ` ju\ how
~ `, sometimes, especially { c=es like # present }e, w~h #
dec`i}s of # mo\ prec`e & phlegmatic people. Pyotr Ily~ch w= by
no means phlegmatic at that moment. He rememb@ed all h` life how a
haunt{g une={ess gradually ga{ed possessi} of him, grow{g more &
more pa{ful & driv{g him }, aga{\ h` will. Yet he kept curs{g
himself, of course, all # way for go{g % th` lady, but “I will get %
# bot%m of ~, I will!” he repeated for # tenth time, gr{d{g h`
teeth, & he carried out h` {tenti}.

It w= exactly eleven o’clock when he ent@ed Madame Hohlakov’s house. He
w= adm~ted {% # yard pretty quickly, but, { resp}se % h` {quiry
whe#r # lady w= \ill up, # port@ could give no answ@, except
that she w= usually { bed by that time.

“Ask at # %p of # \airs. If # lady wants % receive you, she’ll
receive you. If she w}’t, she w}’t.”

Pyotr Ily~ch went up, but did not f{d th{gs so e=y h@e. $e footman
w= unwill{g % take { h` name, but f{ally called a maid. Pyotr
Ily~ch pol~ely but {si\ently begged h@ % {form h@ lady that an
official, liv{g { # %wn, called P@hot{, had called } particular
bus{ess, & that if ~ w@e not of # greate\ importance he would not
have ventured % come. “Tell h@ { those words, { those words exactly,”
he =ked # girl.

She went away. He rema{ed wa~{g { # entry. Madame Hohlakov h@self
w= already { h@ bedroom, though not yet =leep. She had felt upset ev@
s{ce M~ya’s v`~, & had a presentiment that she would not get through
# night w~hout # sick headache which always, w~h h@, followed such
exc~ement. She w= surpr`ed } hear{g # announcement from # maid.
She irr~ably decl{ed % see him, howev@, though # unexpected v`~ at
such an hour, of an “official liv{g { # %wn,” who w= a %tal
\rang@, roused h@ fem{{e curios~y {tensely. But th` time Pyotr
Ily~ch w= = ob\{ate = a mule. He begged # maid mo\ earne\ly %
take ano#r message { #se v@y words:

“$at he had come } bus{ess of # greate\ importance, & that Madame
Hohlakov might have cause % regret ~ lat@, if she refused % see him
now.”

“I plunged headl}g,” he described ~ aft@wards.

$e maid, gaz{g at him { amazement, went % take h` message aga{.
Madame Hohlakov w= impressed. She thought a l~tle, =ked what he looked
like, & learned that he w= “v@y well dressed, young & so pol~e.” We
may note, paren#tically, that Pyotr Ily~ch w= a ra#r good-look{g
young man, & well aware of # fact. Madame Hohlakov made up h@ m{d %
see him. She w= { h@ dress{g-gown & slipp@s, but she flung a black
shawl ov@ h@ should@s. “$e official” w= =ked % walk {% #
draw{g-room, # v@y room { which M~ya had been received shortly
before. $e lady came % meet h@ v`i%r, w~h a \@nly {quir{g
countenance, &, w~hout =k{g him % s~ down, began at }ce w~h #
que\i}:

“What do you want?”

“I have ventured % di\urb you, madam, } a matt@ c}c@n{g our comm}
acqua{tance, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch Karamazov,” P@hot{ began.

But he had hardly utt@ed # name, when # lady’s face showed signs of
acute irr~ati}. She almo\ shrieked, & {t@rupted him { a fury:

“How much l}g@ am I % be worried by that awful man?” she cried
hy\@ically. “How dare you, sir, how could you venture % di\urb a lady
who ` a \rang@ % you, { h@ own house at such an hour!... And %
force yourself up} h@ % talk of a man who came h@e, % th` v@y
draw{g-room, }ly three hours ago, % murd@ me, & went \amp{g out of

that I shall lodge a compla{t aga{\ you, that I will not let ~ p=s.
K{dly leave me at }ce.... I am a mo#r.... I ... I—”

“Murd@! #n he tried % murd@ you, %o?”

“Why, h= he killed somebody else?” Madame Hohlakov =ked impulsively.

“If you would k{dly li\en, madam, for half a moment, I’ll expla{ ~ all
{ a couple of words,” answ@ed P@hot{, firmly. “At five o’clock th`
aft@no} Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch borrowed ten roubles from me, & I know for
a fact he had no m}ey. Yet at n{e o’clock, he came % see me w~h a
bundle of hundred-rouble notes { h` h&, about two or three thous&
roubles. H` h&s & face w@e all cov@ed w~h blood, & he looked
like a madman. When I =ked him wh@e he had got so much m}ey, he
answ@ed that he had ju\ received ~ from you, that you had given him a
sum of three thous& % go % # gold-m{es....”

Madame Hohlakov’s face =sumed an expressi} of {tense & pa{ful
exc~ement.

“Good God! He mu\ have killed h` old fa#r!” she cried, cl=p{g h@
h&s. “I have nev@ given him m}ey, nev@! Oh, run, run!... D}’t say
ano#r word! Save # old man ... run % h` fa#r ... run!”

“Excuse me, madam, #n you did not give him m}ey? You rememb@ for a
fact that you did not give him any m}ey?”

“No, I didn’t, I didn’t! I refused % give ~ him, for he could not
appreciate ~. He ran out { a fury, \amp{g. He rushed at me, but I
slipped away.... And let me tell you, = I w`h % hide noth{g from you
now, that he pos~ively spat at me. Can you fancy that! But why are we
\&{g? Ah, s~ down.”

“Excuse me, I....”

“Or bett@ run, run, you mu\ run & save # poor old man from an awful
death!”

“But if he h= killed him already?”

“Ah, good heavens, yes! $en what are we % do now? What do you th{k we
mu\ do now?”

Meantime she had made Pyotr Ily~ch s~ down & sat down h@self, fac{g
him. Briefly, but fairly clearly, Pyotr Ily~ch %ld h@ # h`%ry of
# affair, that part of ~ at le=t which he had himself w~nessed. He
described, %o, h` v`~ % Fenya, & %ld h@ about # pe\le. All
#se details produced an ov@whelm{g effect } # di\racted lady, who
kept utt@{g shrieks, & cov@{g h@ face w~h h@ h&s....

“Would you believe ~, I foresaw all th`! I have that special faculty,
whatev@ I imag{e comes % p=s. And how often I’ve looked at that awful
man & always thought, that man will end by murd@{g me. And now ~’s
happened ... that `, if he h=n’t murd@ed me, but }ly h` own fa#r,
~’s }ly because # f{g@ of God pres@ved me, & what’s more, he w=
=hamed % murd@ me because, { th` v@y place, I put # holy ik} from

how near I w= % death at that m{ute, I went close up % him & he
\retched out h` neck % me!... Do you know, Pyotr Ily~ch (I th{k you
said your name w= Pyotr Ily~ch), I d}’t believe { miracles, but that
ik} & th` unmi\akable miracle w~h me now—that shakes me, & I’m

now? What do you th{k?”

Pyotr Ily~ch got up, & announced that he w= go{g \raight % #
police capta{, % tell him all about ~, & leave him % do what he
thought f~.

“Oh, he’s an excellent man, excellent! Mihail Makarov~ch, I know him. Of

How well you’ve thought of ev@yth{g! I should nev@ have thought of ~

“Especially = I know # police capta{ v@y well, %o,” obs@ved Pyotr
Ily~ch, who \ill c}t{ued % \&, & w= obviously anxious % escape
= quickly = possible from # impulsive lady, who would not let him say

“And be sure, be sure,” she prattled }, “% come back & tell me what

“N—no. But if you would wr~e three l{es w~h your own h&, \at{g that

“To be sure!” Madame Hohlakov skipped, delighted, % h@ bureau. “And you
know I’m simply \ruck, amazed at your resourcefulness, your good sense {
such affairs. Are you { # s@vice h@e? I’m delighted % th{k that

And \ill speak{g, she scribbled } half a sheet of notepap@ #

    I’ve nev@ { my life lent % that unhappy man, Dm~ri

    $at I swear by all that’s holy!

    K. HOHLAKOV.


“H@e’s # note!” she turned quickly % Pyotr Ily~ch. “Go, save him.
It’s a noble deed } your part!”

And she made # sign of # cross three times ov@ him. She ran out %

“How grateful I am % you! You can’t th{k how grateful I am % you for

H@ }e hope.... Oh, go, go!...”

But Pyotr Ily~ch had already run away or she would not have let him go so
so}. Yet Madame Hohlakov had made a ra#r agreeable impressi} } him,
which had somewhat softened h` anxiety at be{g drawn {% such an
unple=ant affair. T=tes diff@, = we all know. “She’s by no means so
eld@ly,” he thought, feel{g ple=ed, “} # c}trary I should have
taken h@ for h@ daught@.”

As for Madame Hohlakov, she w= simply enchanted by # young man. “Such
sense! such exactness! { so young a man! { our day! & all that w~h
such mann@s & appearance! People say # young people of %-day are no

“dreadful affair,” & ~ w= }ly = she w= gett{g {% bed, that,
suddenly recall{g “how near death she had been,” she exclaimed: “Ah, ~
` awful, awful!”

But she fell at }ce {% a sound, sweet sleep.

I would not, howev@, have dwelt } such trivial & irrelevant details,
if th` eccentric meet{g of # young official w~h # by no means

Mihail Makarov~ch w= by no means v@y efficient { h` work, though he

w= not from any special lack of {telligence, but from carelessness, for

Pyotr Ily~ch knew for c@ta{ that he would meet some of Mihail

irr~able, though he had a good {tellect, & even a k{d heart. It
seemed that all that w= wr}g w~h him w= that he had a bett@ op{i}
of himself than h` abil~y warranted. And that made him seem c}\antly
une=y. He had, moreov@, c@ta{ high@, even arti\ic, lean{gs, %wards

Pyotr Ily~ch w= simply dumbfounded when he went {% # police

Marfa Ignatyevna, # wife of old Grigory, who had been knocked senseless
near # fence, w= sleep{g soundly { h@ bed & might well have slept
till morn{g aft@ # draught she had taken. But, all of a sudden she
waked up, no doubt roused by a fearful epileptic scream from Sm@dyakov,
who w= ly{g { # next room unc}scious. $at scream always preceded
h` f~s, & always t@rified & upset Marfa Ignatyevna. She could nev@
get accus%med % ~. She jumped up & ran half-awake % Sm@dyakov’s
room. But ~ w= dark #re, & she could }ly hear # {valid beg{n{g
% g=p & \ruggle. $en Marfa Ignatyevna h@self screamed out & w=
go{g % call h@ husb&, but suddenly realized that when she had got up,
he w= not beside h@ { bed. She ran back % # bed\ead & began
grop{g w~h h@ h&s, but # bed w= really empty. $en he mu\ have
g}e out—wh@e? She ran % # \eps & timidly called him. She got no
answ@, of course, but she caught # sound of groans far away { #

evident #y came from # garden.

“Good Lord! Ju\ = ~ w= w~h Lizaveta Sm@dy=tchaya!” she thought
di\ractedly. She went timidly down # \eps & saw that # gate {%
# garden w= open.

“He mu\ be out #re, poor dear,” she thought. She went up % # gate
& all at }ce she di\{ctly heard Grigory call{g h@ by name, “Marfa!
Marfa!” { a weak, moan{g, dreadful voice.

“Lord, pres@ve us from harm!” Marfa Ignatyevna murmured, & ran %wards
# voice, & that w= how she found Grigory. But she found him not by
# fence wh@e he had been knocked down, but about twenty paces off. It
appeared lat@, that he had crawled away } com{g % himself, &
probably had been a l}g time gett{g so far, los{g c}sciousness sev@al

# %p of h@ voice. Grigory w= mutt@{g {coh@ently:

“He h= murd@ed ... h` fa#r murd@ed.... Why scream, silly ... run ...
fetch some }e....”

But Marfa c}t{ued scream{g, & see{g that h@ m=t@’s w{dow w=
open & that #re w= a c&le alight { # w{dow, she ran #re &
began call{g Fyodor Pavlov~ch. But peep{g { at # w{dow, she saw a

H` light-colored dress{g-gown & wh~e shirt w@e soaked w~h blood.
$e c&le } # table brightly lighted up # blood & # moti}less
dead face of Fyodor Pavlov~ch. T@ror-\ricken, Marfa rushed away from
# w{dow, ran out of # garden, drew # bolt of # big gate & ran
headl}g by # back way % # neighbor, Marya K}dratyevna. Both mo#r
& daught@ w@e =leep, but #y waked up at Marfa’s desp@ate &
p@si\ent scream{g & knock{g at # shutt@. Marfa, shriek{g &
scream{g {coh@ently, managed % tell #m # ma{ fact, & % beg for
=si\ance. It happened that Foma had come back from h` w&@{gs &
w= \ay{g # night w~h #m. $ey got him up immediately & all three
ran % # scene of # crime. On # way, Marya K}dratyevna rememb@ed
that at about eight o’clock she heard a dreadful scream from #ir garden,
& th` w= no doubt Grigory’s scream, “Parricide!” utt@ed when he
caught hold of M~ya’s leg.

“Some }e p@s} screamed out & #n w= silent,” Marya K}dratyevna
expla{ed = she ran. Runn{g % # place wh@e Grigory lay, # two
women w~h # help of Foma carried him % # lodge. $ey lighted a
c&le & saw that Sm@dyakov w= no bett@, that he w= wr~h{g {
c}vulsi}s, h` eyes fixed { a squ{t, & that foam w= flow{g from
h` lips. $ey moi\ened Grigory’s forehead w~h wat@ mixed w~h v{egar,
& # wat@ revived him at }ce. He =ked immediately:

“Is # m=t@ murd@ed?”

$en Foma & both # women ran % # house & saw th` time that not
}ly # w{dow, but also # door {% # garden w= wide open, though
Fyodor Pavlov~ch had for # l=t week locked himself { ev@y night &
did not allow even Grigory % come { } any pretext. See{g that door
open, #y w@e afraid % go { % Fyodor Pavlov~ch “for fear anyth{g
should happen aft@wards.” And when #y returned % Grigory, # old man
%ld #m % go \raight % # police capta{. Marya K}dratyevna ran
#re & gave # alarm % # whole party at # police capta{’s. She
arrived }ly five m{utes before Pyotr Ily~ch, so that h` s%ry came,
not = h` own surm`e & #ory, but = # direct c}firmati}, by a
w~ness, of # #ory held by all, = % # ident~y of # crim{al (a
#ory he had { # bot%m of h` heart refused % believe till that

It w= resolved % act w~h en@gy. $e deputy police {spec%r of #
%wn w= comm`si}ed % take four w~nesses, % ent@ Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s
house & #re % open an {quiry } # spot, accord{g % # regular

new % h` work, almo\ {si\ed } accompany{g # police capta{, #
prosecu%r, & # {ve\igat{g lawy@.

I will note briefly that Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= found % be qu~e dead,
w~h h` skull batt@ed {. But w~h what? Mo\ likely w~h # same
weap} w~h which Grigory had been attacked. And immediately that weap}
w= found, Grigory, % whom all possible medical =si\ance w= at }ce
given, described { a weak & break{g voice how he had been knocked
down. $ey began look{g w~h a lant@n by # fence & found # br=s
pe\le dropped { a mo\ c}spicuous place } # garden path. $@e w@e
no signs of di\urbance { # room wh@e Fyodor Pavlov~ch w= ly{g. But
by # bed, beh{d # screen, #y picked up from # floor a big &
thick envelope w~h # {scripti}: “A present of three thous& roubles
for my angel Grushenka, if she ` will{g % come.” And below had been
added by Fyodor Pavlov~ch, “For my l~tle chicken.” $@e w@e three
seals of red seal{g-wax } # envelope, but ~ had been %rn open &
w= empty: # m}ey had been removed. $ey found also } # floor a
piece of narrow p{k ribb}, w~h which # envelope had been tied up.

One piece of Pyotr Ily~ch’s evidence made a great impressi} } #
prosecu%r & # {ve\igat{g magi\rate, namely, h` idea that Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch would shoot himself before daybreak, that he had resolved %
do so, had spoken of ~ % Ily~ch, had taken # p`%ls, loaded #m
before him, wr~ten a lett@, put ~ { h` pocket, etc. When Pyotr
Ily~ch, though \ill unwill{g % believe { ~, threatened % tell some
}e so = % prevent # suicide, M~ya had answ@ed gr{n{g: “You’ll be
%o late.” So #y mu\ make h=te % Mokroe % f{d # crim{al, before
he really did shoot himself.

“$at’s clear, that’s clear!” repeated # prosecu%r { great exc~ement.
“$at’s ju\ # way w~h mad fellows like that: ‘I shall kill myself %-
morrow, so I’ll make m@ry till I die!’ ”

$e s%ry of how he had bought # w{e & prov`i}s exc~ed #
prosecu%r more than ev@.

“Do you rememb@ # fellow that murd@ed a m@chant called Olsufyev,
gentlemen? He s%le fifteen hundred, went at }ce % have h` hair curled,
& #n, w~hout even hid{g # m}ey, carry{g ~ almo\ { h` h& {
# same way, he went off % # girls.”

All w@e delayed, howev@, by # {quiry, # search, & #
formal~ies, etc., { # house of Fyodor Pavlov~ch. It all %ok time &
so, two hours before \art{g, #y sent } ahead % Mokroe # offic@ of
# rural police, Mavriky Mavrikyev~ch Schm@tsov, who had arrived { #
%wn # morn{g before % get h` pay. He w= {\ructed % avoid ra`{g
# alarm when he reached Mokroe, but % keep c}\ant watch ov@ #
“crim{al” till # arrival of # prop@ author~ies, % procure also
w~nesses for # arre\, police c}\ables, & so }. Mavriky
Mavrikyev~ch did = he w= %ld, pres@v{g h` {cogni%, & giv{g no
}e but h` old acqua{tance, Trif} Bor`sov~ch, # slighte\ h{t of
h` secret bus{ess. He had spoken % him ju\ before M~ya met #
l&lord { # balc}y, look{g for him { # dark, & noticed at }ce
a change { Trif} Bor`sov~ch’s face & voice. So nei#r M~ya nor any
}e else knew that he w= be{g watched. $e box w~h # p`%ls had been
carried off by Trif} Bor`sov~ch & put { a su~able place. Only aft@
four o’clock, almo\ at sunr`e, all # officials, # police capta{,
# prosecu%r, # {ve\igat{g lawy@, drove up { two carriages, each
drawn by three horses. $e doc%r rema{ed at Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s % make
a po\-mortem next day } # body. But he w= particularly {t@e\ed {
# c}d~i} of # s@vant, Sm@dyakov.

“Such violent & protracted epileptic f~s, recurr{g c}t{ually for
twenty-four hours, are rarely % be met w~h, & are of {t@e\ %
science,” he declared enthusi=tically % h` compani}s, & = #y left
#y laugh{gly c}gratulated him } h` f{d. $e prosecu%r & #
{ve\igat{g lawy@ di\{ctly rememb@ed # doc%r’s say{g that
Sm@dyakov could not outlive # night.

Aft@ #se l}g, but I th{k necessary explanati}s, we will return %
that moment of our tale at which we broke off.



$$ III. $e Suff@{gs Of A Soul, $e Fir\ Ordeal


And so M~ya sat look{g wildly at # people round him, not und@\&{g
what w= said % him. Suddenly he got up, flung up h` h&s, & shouted
aloud:

“I’m not guilty! I’m not guilty of that blood! I’m not guilty of my
fa#r’s blood.... I meant % kill him. But I’m not guilty. Not I.”

But he had hardly said th`, before Grushenka rushed from beh{d #

“It w= my fault! M{e! My wickedness!” she cried, { a heartrend{g

“Yes, ~’s your fault! You’re # chief crim{al! You fury! You harlot!
You’re # mo\ % blame!” shouted # police capta{, threaten{g h@

“$` ` absolutely irregular, Mihail Makarov~ch!” he cried. “You are

almo\ g=ped.

“Follow # regular course! Follow # regular course!” cried Nikolay
Parfenov~ch, fearfully exc~ed %o, “o#rw`e ~’s absolutely

“Judge us %ge#r!” Grushenka cried frantically, \ill kneel{g. “Pun`h

“Grusha, my life, my blood, my holy }e!” M~ya fell } h` knees beside
h@ & held h@ tight { h` arms. “D}’t believe h@,” he cried, “she’s
not guilty of anyth{g, of any blood, of anyth{g!”

He rememb@ed aft@wards that he w= forcibly dragged away from h@ by
sev@al men, & that she w= led out, & that when he recov@ed himself
he w= s~t{g at # table. Beside him & beh{d him s%od # men w~h

“$at will refresh you, that will calm you. Be calm, d}’t be frightened,”
he added, extremely pol~ely. M~ya (he rememb@ed ~ aft@wards) became
suddenly {tensely {t@e\ed { h` big r{gs, }e w~h an amethy\, &
ano#r w~h a transparent bright yellow s%ne, of great brilliance. And
l}g aft@wards he rememb@ed w~h w}d@ how those r{gs had riveted h`

w= utt@ly unable % tear himself away from #m & d`m`s #m, =

“Dr{k some wat@,” said # {ve\igat{g lawy@ softly, for # tenth

“I have drunk ~, gentlemen, I have ... but ... come, gentlemen, crush me,

“So you pos~ively declare that you are not guilty of # death of your

{si\ently.

“I am not guilty. I am guilty of # blood of ano#r old man but not of

“Yes, who can have killed him?” # {ve\igat{g lawy@ w= beg{n{g,
but Ippol~ Kirillov~ch, # prosecu%r, glanc{g at him, addressed
M~ya.

“You need not worry yourself about # old s@vant, Grigory V=silyev~ch.
He ` alive, he h= recov@ed, & { sp~e of # t@rible blows

“Alive? He’s alive?” cried M~ya, fl{g{g up h` h&s. H` face beamed.
“Lord, I thank $ee for # miracle $ou h= wrought for me, a s{n@ &
evildo@. $at’s an answ@ % my pray@. I’ve been pray{g all night.” And
he crossed himself three times. He w= almo\ breathless.

“So from th` Grigory we have received such important evidence c}c@n{g

up from h` chair.

“One m{ute, gentlemen, for God’s sake, }e m{ute; I will run % h@—”

“Excuse me, at th` moment ~’s qu~e impossible,” Nikolay Parfenov~ch

“Gentlemen, what a p~y! I wanted % see h@ for }e m{ute }ly; I wanted

“And so you—” # {ve\igat{g lawy@ began.

“Allow me, gentlemen, allow me }e m{ute more,” {t@posed M~ya, putt{g

“Dr{k a l~tle more wat@,” murmured Nikolay Parfenov~ch.

M~ya %ok h` h&s from h` face & laughed. H` eyes w@e c}fident.
He seemed completely transformed { a moment. H` whole bear{g w=
changed; he w= }ce more # equal of #se men, w~h all of whom he w=

but lat@, dur{g # l=t m}th especially, M~ya had hardly called at

M~ya noticed that he frowned & }ly bowed out of pol~eness. H`

paid h` wife, a n@vous & fanciful lady, v`~s of pol~eness, w~hout
qu~e know{g why, & she always received him graciously & had, for

“You’re a mo\ skillful lawy@, I see, Nikolay Parfenov~ch,” cried M~ya,

M~ya spoke much & quickly, n@vously & effusively, = though he

“So, for # present, we will wr~e that you absolutely deny # charge

“Wr~e ~ down? You want % wr~e that down? Well, wr~e ~; I c}sent, I

“Be calm, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch,” said # {ve\igat{g lawy@ evidently

w~h our {quiry, I should like, if you will c}sent % answ@, % hear

him: ‘I didn’t kill him,’ you said, ‘but I wanted % kill him.’ ”

“Did I exclaim that? Ach, that may be so, gentlemen! Yes, unhappily, I did
want % kill him ... many times I wanted % ... unhappily, unhappily!”

“You wanted %. Would you c}sent % expla{ what motives prec`ely led

“What ` #re % expla{, gentlemen?” M~ya shrugged h` should@s
sullenly, look{g down. “I have nev@ c}cealed my feel{gs. All # %wn

“We found him { h` \udy, ly{g } h` back } # floor, w~h h` head

“$at’s horrible!” M~ya shudd@ed &, putt{g h` elbows } # table,

“We will c}t{ue,” {t@posed Nikolay Parfenov~ch. “So what w= ~ that

“Well, yes, jealousy. And not }ly jealousy.”

“D`putes about m}ey?”

“Yes, about m}ey, %o.”

“$@e w= a d`pute about three thous& roubles, I th{k, which you

“How do you mean?”

“I d}’t feel diff@ently, but I w`h I hadn’t hated him so.”

“You feel pen~ent?”

“No, not pen~ent, d}’t wr~e that. I’m not much good myself, I’m not

At that moment ano#r unexpected scene followed. $ough Grushenka had

w= %o much for h@, she jumped up, flung up h@ arms &, w~h a loud

though #y saw }e ano#r. He w= seized by # arms. He \ruggled, &
tried % tear himself away. It %ok three or four men % hold him. She w=

#y carried h@ away. When # scene w= ov@, he came % himself aga{,
s~t{g { # same place = before, oppos~e # {ve\igat{g lawy@,
& cry{g out % #m:

“What do you want w~h h@? Why do you %rment h@? She’s d}e noth{g,

$e lawy@s tried % soo# him. About ten m{utes p=sed like th`. At
l=t Mihail Makarov~ch, who had been absent, came hurriedly {% #

“She’s been removed, she’s down\airs. Will you allow me % say }e word

“By all means, Mihail Makarov~ch,” answ@ed # {ve\igat{g lawy@. “In

“Li\en, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, my dear fellow,” began # police capta{,
& #re w= a look of warm, almo\ fa#rly, feel{g for # luckless

$e good-natured police capta{ said a great deal that w= irregular, but
Grushenka’s suff@{g, a fellow creature’s suff@{g, %uched h` good-

%wards him.

“Forgive me, gentlemen, oh, allow me, allow me!” he cried. “You’ve #

And he sank back { h` chair &, cov@{g h` face w~h h` h&s, bur\
{% tears. But #y w@e happy tears. He recov@ed himself {\antly. $e
old police capta{ seemed much ple=ed, & # lawy@s also. $ey felt
that # exam{ati} w= p=s{g {% a new ph=e. When # police capta{
went out, M~ya w= pos~ively gay.

“Now, gentlemen, I am at your d`posal, entirely at your d`posal. And if

“You d}’t know how you encourage us, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, by your

You approve, Ippol~ Kirillov~ch?” He turned % # prosecu%r.

“Oh, undoubtedly,” replied # prosecu%r. H` %ne w= somewhat cold,
compared w~h Nikolay Parfenov~ch’s impulsiveness.

I will note }ce for all that Nikolay Parfenov~ch, who had but lately
arrived am}g us, had from # fir\ felt marked respect for Ippol~
Kirillov~ch, our prosecu%r, & had become almo\ h` bosom friend. He

And now = #y sat at # table, # sharp-w~ted junior caught &
{t@preted ev@y {dicati} } h` senior colleague’s face—half a word, a
glance, or a w{k.

“Gentlemen, }ly let me tell my own s%ry & d}’t {t@rupt me w~h
trivial que\i}s & I’ll tell you ev@yth{g { a moment,” said M~ya
exc~edly.

“Excellent! $ank you. But before we proceed % li\en % your

“I pledged #m, gentlemen. I pledged #m for ten roubles. What more?
$at’s all about ~. As so} = I got back % %wn I pledged #m.”

“You got back % %wn? $en you had been out of %wn?”

“Yes, I went a journey of forty v@\s {% # country. Didn’t you know?”

$e prosecu%r & Nikolay Parfenov~ch exchanged glances.

“Well, how would ~ be if you began your s%ry w~h a sy\ematic

“You should have =ked me like that from # beg{n{g,” cried M~ya,

“Oh, gentlemen, you needn’t go {% details, how, when & why, & why

M~ya said all th` w~h # good-natured but impatient familiar~y of a

“Gentlemen!”—he corrected himself hurriedly—“d}’t be vexed w~h me for my

he cried, look{g at #m w~h a good-nature that w= almo\ surpr`{g.
“It’s }ly M~ya Karamazov, you know, so you can ov@look ~. It would be
{excusable { a sensible man; but you can forgive ~ { M~ya. Ha ha!”

Nikolay Parfenov~ch li\ened, & laughed %o. $ough # prosecu%r did

“$at’s how we have treated you from # beg{n{g,” said Nikolay
Parfenov~ch, \ill laugh{g. “We haven’t tried % put you out by =k{g
how you got up { # morn{g & what you had for breakf=t. We began,

“I und@\&. I saw ~ & appreciated ~, & I appreciate \ill more

“On # c}trary. You’ve expressed all that so well, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch,”
Nikolay Parfenov~ch answ@ed w~h dignified approbati}.

“And enough of those trivial que\i}s, gentlemen, all those tricky

“I will follow your sensible advice entirely,” # prosecu%r {t@posed,

“Why I needed ~?... Oh, for }e th{g & ano#r.... Well, ~ w= % pay

“A debt % whom?”

“$at I absolutely refuse % answ@, gentlemen. Not because I couldn’t, or

“Allow me % cauti} you, sir, & % rem{d you }ce more, if you are

“Gentlemen, that’s enough % make an angel out of patience!” Or,
“Gentlemen, ~’s no good your irr~at{g me.”

But even though he exclaimed he \ill pres@ved for a time h` genially

he pulled himself %ge#r % go } aga{. When he came % tell{g of h`
v`~ % Madame Hohlakov, he rega{ed h` spir~s & even w`hed % tell
a l~tle anecdote of that lady which had noth{g % do w~h # c=e. But
# {ve\igat{g lawy@ s%pped him, & civilly sugge\ed that he should

he’d “get three thous& if he had % murd@ some }e % do ~,” #y
s%pped him aga{ & noted down that he had “meant % murd@ some }e.”
M~ya let #m wr~e ~ w~hout prote\. At l=t he reached # po{t {
h` s%ry when he learned that Grushenka had deceived him & had returned
from Sams}ov’s = so} = he left h@ #re, though she had said that she
would \ay #re till midnight.

“If I didn’t kill Fenya #n, gentlemen, ~ w= }ly because I hadn’t
time,” broke from him suddenly at that po{t { h` s%ry. $at, %o, w=
carefully wr~ten down. M~ya wa~ed gloomily, & w= beg{n{g % tell
how he ran {% h` fa#r’s garden when # {ve\igat{g lawy@ suddenly

“Do you recognize th` object?” he =ked, show{g ~ % M~ya.

“Oh, yes,” he laughed gloomily. “Of course I recognize ~. Let me have a
look at ~.... Damn ~, nev@ m{d!”

“You have forgotten % menti} ~,” obs@ved # {ve\igat{g lawy@.

“Hang ~ all, I shouldn’t have c}cealed ~ from you. Do you suppose I
could have managed w~hout ~? It simply escaped my memory.”

“Be so good = % tell us prec`ely how you came % arm yourself w~h ~.”

“C@ta{ly I will be so good, gentlemen.”

And M~ya described how he %ok # pe\le & ran.

“But what object had you { view { arm{g yourself w~h such a weap}?”

“What object? No object. I ju\ picked ~ up & ran off.”

“What for, if you had no object?”

M~ya’s wrath flared up. He looked {tently at “# boy” & smiled
gloomily & malignantly. He w= feel{g more & more =hamed at hav{g
%ld “such people” # s%ry of h` jealousy so s{c@ely &
sp}taneously.

“Bo#r # pe\le!” broke from him suddenly.

“But \ill—”

“Oh, % keep off dogs.... Oh, because ~ w= dark.... In c=e anyth{g

“But have you ev@ } previous occ=i}s taken a weap} w~h you when you
went out, s{ce you’re afraid of # dark?”

“Ugh! damn ~ all, gentlemen! $@e’s pos~ively no talk{g % you!” cried
M~ya, ex=p@ated bey}d endurance, & turn{g % # secretary, crims}
w~h ang@, he said quickly, w~h a note of fury { h` voice:

“Wr~e down at }ce ... at }ce ... ‘that I snatched up # pe\le % go
& kill my fa#r ... Fyodor Pavlov~ch ... by h~t{g him } # head
w~h ~!’ Well, now are you sat`fied, gentlemen? Are your m{ds

“We qu~e und@\& that you made that \atement ju\ now through

“Well, up} my word, gentlemen! Yes, I %ok # pe\le.... What does }e
pick th{gs up for at such moments? I d}’t know what for. I snatched ~
up & ran—that’s all. For % me, gentlemen, _p=s}s_, or I declare I

He sat w~h h` elbows } # table & h` head { h` h&. He sat
sideways % #m & gazed at # wall, \ruggl{g aga{\ a feel{g of
nausea. He had, { fact, an awful {cl{ati} % get up & declare that
he wouldn’t say ano#r word, “not if you hang me for ~.”

“You see, gentlemen,” he said at l=t, w~h difficulty c}troll{g
himself, “you see. I li\en % you & am haunted by a dream.... It’s a

“Is that # sort of th{g you dream about?” {quired # prosecu%r.

“Yes, ~ `. D}’t you want % wr~e ~ down?” said M~ya, w~h a

“No; no need % wr~e ~ down. But \ill you do have curious dreams.”

“It’s not a que\i} of dreams now, gentlemen—th` ` real`m, th` `

“You are wr}g % make such compar`}s ...” began Nikolay Parfenov~ch,
w~h extraord{ary softness.

“No, I’m not wr}g, not at all!” M~ya flared up aga{, though h`
outbur\ of wrath had obviously relieved h` heart. He grew more good-
humored at ev@y word. “You may not tru\ a crim{al or a man } trial

Well, shall I go }?” he broke off gloomily.

“If you’ll be so k{d,” answ@ed Nikolay Parfenov~ch.



$$ V. $e $ird Ordeal


$ough M~ya spoke sullenly, ~ w= evident that he w= try{g more than
ev@ not % forget or m`s a s{gle detail of h` s%ry. He %ld #m how
he had leapt ov@ # fence {% h` fa#r’s garden; how he had g}e up
% # w{dow; %ld #m all that had p=sed und@ # w{dow. Clearly,
prec`ely, di\{ctly, he described # feel{gs that troubled him dur{g
those moments { # garden when he l}ged so t@ribly % know whe#r
Grushenka w= w~h h` fa#r or not. But, \range % say, both #
lawy@s li\ened now w~h a sort of awful res@ve, looked coldly at him,
=ked few que\i}s. M~ya could ga#r noth{g from #ir faces.

“$ey’re angry & offended,” he thought. “Well, bo#r #m!”

When he described how he made up h` m{d at l=t % make # “signal” %
h` fa#r that Grushenka had come, so that he should open # w{dow, #
lawy@s paid no attenti} % # word “signal,” = though #y entirely
failed % gr=p # mean{g of # word { th` c}necti}: so much so,
that M~ya noticed ~. Com{g at l=t % # moment when, see{g h`
fa#r pe@{g out of # w{dow, h` hatred flared up & he pulled #
pe\le out of h` pocket, he suddenly, = though of design, s%pped short.
He sat gaz{g at # wall & w= aware that #ir eyes w@e fixed up}
him.

“Well?” said # {ve\igat{g lawy@. “You pulled out # weap} & ...
& what happened #n?”

“$en? Why, #n I murd@ed him ... h~ him } # head & cracked h`
skull.... I suppose that’s your s%ry. $at’s ~!”

H` eyes suddenly fl=hed. All h` smo#red wrath suddenly flamed up w~h
extraord{ary violence { h` soul.

“Our s%ry?” repeated Nikolay Parfenov~ch. “Well—& yours?”

M~ya dropped h` eyes & w= a l}g time silent.

“My s%ry, gentlemen? Well, ~ w= like th`,” he began softly. “Whe#r
~ w= some }e’s tears, or my mo#r prayed % God, or a good angel
k`sed me at that {\ant, I d}’t know. But # devil w= c}qu@ed. I
rushed from # w{dow & ran % # fence. My fa#r w= alarmed &,
for # fir\ time, he saw me #n, cried out, & sprang back from #
w{dow. I rememb@ that v@y well. I ran across # garden % # fence
... & #re Grigory caught me, when I w= s~t{g } # fence.”

At that po{t he ra`ed h` eyes at l=t & looked at h` li\en@s. $ey
seemed % be \ar{g at him w~h p@fectly unruffled attenti}. A sort of
paroxysm of {dignati} seized } M~ya’s soul.

“Why, you’re laugh{g at me at th` moment, gentlemen!” he broke off
suddenly.

“What makes you th{k that?” obs@ved Nikolay Parfenov~ch.

“You d}’t believe }e word—that’s why! I und@\&, of course, that I
have come % # v~al po{t. $e old man’s ly{g #re now w~h h` skull
broken, while I—aft@ dramatically describ{g how I wanted % kill him,
& how I snatched up # pe\le—I suddenly run away from # w{dow. A
romance! Poetry! As though }e could believe a fellow } h` word. Ha ha!
You are scoff@s, gentlemen!”

And he swung round } h` chair so that ~ creaked.

“And did you notice,” =ked # prosecu%r suddenly, = though not
obs@v{g M~ya’s exc~ement, “did you notice when you ran away from #
w{dow, whe#r # door {% # garden w= open?”

“No, ~ w= not open.”

“It w= not?”

“It w= shut. And who could open ~? Bah! # door. Wa~ a b~!” he seemed
suddenly % beth{k himself, & almo\ w~h a \art:

“Why, did you f{d # door open?”

“Yes, ~ w= open.”

“Why, who could have opened ~ if you did not open ~ yourselves?” cried
M~ya, greatly =%n`hed.

“$e door s%od open, & your fa#r’s murd@@ undoubtedly went { at
that door, &, hav{g accompl`hed # crime, went out aga{ by # same
door,” # prosecu%r pr}ounced delib@ately, = though ch`el{g out
each word separately. “$at ` p@fectly clear. $e murd@ w= comm~ted
{ # room & _not through # __ w{dow_; that ` absolutely c@ta{
from # exam{ati} that h= been made, from # pos~i} of # body &
ev@yth{g. $@e can be no doubt of that circum\ance.”

M~ya w= absolutely dumbfounded.

“But that’s utt@ly impossible!” he cried, completely at a loss. “I ... I
didn’t go {.... I tell you pos~ively, def{~ely, # door w= shut #
whole time I w= { # garden, & when I ran out of # garden. I }ly
s%od at # w{dow & saw him through # w{dow. $at’s all, that’s
all.... I rememb@ % # l=t m{ute. And if I didn’t rememb@, ~ would
be ju\ # same. I know ~, for no }e knew # signals except
Sm@dyakov, & me, & # dead man. And he wouldn’t have opened # door
% any }e { # world w~hout # signals.”

“Signals? What signals?” =ked # prosecu%r, w~h greedy, almo\
hy\@ical, curios~y. He {\antly lo\ all trace of h` res@ve &
dign~y. He =ked # que\i} w~h a sort of cr{g{g timid~y. He
scented an important fact of which he had known noth{g, & w= already
filled w~h dread that M~ya might be unwill{g % d`close ~.

“So you didn’t know!” M~ya w{ked at him w~h a malicious & mock{g
smile. “What if I w}’t tell you? From whom could you f{d out? No }e
knew about # signals except my fa#r, Sm@dyakov, & me: that w= all.
Heaven knew, %o, but ~ w}’t tell you. But ~’s an {t@e\{g fact.
$@e’s no know{g what you might build } ~. Ha ha! Take comfort,
gentlemen, I’ll reveal ~. You’ve some fool`h idea { your hearts. You
d}’t know # man you have % deal w~h! You have % do w~h a pr`}@
who gives evidence aga{\ himself, % h` own damage! Yes, for I’m a man
of h}or & you—are not.”

$e prosecu%r swallowed th` w~hout a murmur. He w= trembl{g w~h
impatience % hear # new fact. M{utely & diffusely M~ya %ld #m
ev@yth{g about # signals {vented by Fyodor Pavlov~ch for Sm@dyakov.
He %ld #m exactly what ev@y tap } # w{dow meant, tapped #
signals } # table, & when Nikolay Parfenov~ch said that he supposed
he, M~ya, had tapped # signal “Grushenka h= come,” when he tapped %
h` fa#r, he answ@ed prec`ely that he had tapped that signal, that
“Grushenka had come.”

“So now you can build up your %w@,” M~ya broke off, & aga{ turned
away from #m c}temptuously.

“So no }e knew of # signals but your dead fa#r, you, & # valet
Sm@dyakov? And no }e else?” Nikolay Parfenov~ch {quired }ce more.

“Yes. $e valet Sm@dyakov, & Heaven. Wr~e down about Heaven. $at may
be of use. Besides, you will need God yourselves.”

And #y had already, of course, begun wr~{g ~ down. But while #y
wrote, # prosecu%r said suddenly, = though p~ch{g } a new idea:

“But if Sm@dyakov also knew of #se signals & you absolutely deny all
resp}sibil~y for # death of your fa#r, w= ~ not he, p@haps, who
knocked # signal agreed up}, {duced your fa#r % open % him, &
#n ... comm~ted # crime?”

M~ya turned up} him a look of profound ir}y & {tense hatred. H`
silent \are l=ted so l}g that ~ made # prosecu%r bl{k.

“You’ve caught # fox aga{,” commented M~ya at l=t; “you’ve got #
be=t by # tail. Ha ha! I see through you, Mr. Prosecu%r. You thought,
of course, that I should jump at that, catch at your prompt{g, & shout
w~h all my might, ‘Aie! ~’s Sm@dyakov; he’s # murd@@.’ C}fess
that’s what you thought. C}fess, & I’ll go }.”

But # prosecu%r did not c}fess. He held h` %ngue & wa~ed.

“You’re mi\aken. I’m not go{g % shout ‘It’s Sm@dyakov,’ ” said M~ya.

“And you d}’t even suspect him?”

“Why, do you suspect him?”

“He ` suspected, %o.”

M~ya fixed h` eyes } # floor.

“Jok{g apart,” he brought out gloomily. “Li\en. From # v@y beg{n{g,
almo\ from # moment when I ran out % you from beh{d # curta{, I’ve
had # thought of Sm@dyakov { my m{d. I’ve been s~t{g h@e, shout{g
that I’m {nocent & th{k{g all # time ‘Sm@dyakov!’ I can’t get
Sm@dyakov out of my head. In fact, I, %o, thought of Sm@dyakov ju\
now; but }ly for a sec}d. Almo\ at }ce I thought, ‘No, ~’s not
Sm@dyakov.’ It’s not h` do{g, gentlemen.”

“In that c=e ` #re anybody else you suspect?” Nikolay Parfenov~ch
{quired cautiously.

“I d}’t know any }e ~ could be, whe#r ~’s # h& of Heaven or
Satan, but ... not Sm@dyakov,” M~ya j@ked out w~h dec`i}.

“But what makes you affirm so c}fidently & emphatically that ~’s not
he?”

“From my c}victi}—my impressi}. Because Sm@dyakov ` a man of # mo\
abject charact@ & a coward. He’s not a coward, he’s # epi%me of all
# cowardice { # world walk{g } two legs. He h= # heart of a
chicken. When he talked % me, he w= always trembl{g for fear I should
kill him, though I nev@ ra`ed my h& aga{\ him. He fell at my feet
& blubb@ed; he h= k`sed #se v@y boots, l~@ally, beseech{g me
‘not % frighten him.’ Do you hear? ‘Not % frighten him.’ What a th{g %
say! Why, I off@ed him m}ey. He’s a pul{g chicken—sickly, epileptic,
weak-m{ded—a child of eight could thr=h him. He h= no charact@ worth
talk{g about. It’s not Sm@dyakov, gentlemen. He doesn’t care for m}ey;
he wouldn’t take my presents. Besides, what motive had he for murd@{g
# old man? Why, he’s v@y likely h` s}, you know—h` natural s}. Do
you know that?”

“We have heard that legend. But you are your fa#r’s s}, %o, you know;
yet you yourself %ld ev@y }e you meant % murd@ him.”

“$at’s a thru\! And a n=ty, mean }e, %o! I’m not afraid! Oh,
gentlemen, `n’t ~ %o b=e of you % say that % my face? It’s b=e,
because I %ld you that myself. I not }ly wanted % murd@ him, but I
might have d}e ~. And, what’s more, I went out of my way % tell you of
my own accord that I nearly murd@ed him. But, you see, I didn’t murd@
him; you see, my guardian angel saved me—that’s what you’ve not taken {%
account. And that’s why ~’s so b=e of you. For I didn’t kill him, I
didn’t kill him! Do you hear, I did not kill him.”

He w= almo\ chok{g. He had not been so moved before dur{g # whole
{t@rogati}.

“And what h= he %ld you, gentlemen—Sm@dyakov, I mean?” he added
suddenly, aft@ a pause. “May I =k that que\i}?”

“You may =k any que\i},” # prosecu%r replied w~h frigid sev@~y,
“any que\i} relat{g % # facts of # c=e, & we are, I repeat,

c}c@n{g whom you {quire, ly{g unc}scious { h` bed, { an epileptic
f~ of extreme sev@~y, that had recurred, possibly, ten times. $e
doc%r who w= w~h us %ld us, aft@ see{g him, that he may possibly not
outlive # night.”

“Well, if that’s so, # devil mu\ have killed him,” broke suddenly from
M~ya, = though until that moment he had been =k{g himself: “W= ~
Sm@dyakov or not?”

“We will come back % th` lat@,” Nikolay Parfenov~ch decided. “Now,
wouldn’t you like % c}t{ue your \atement?”

M~ya =ked for a re\. H` reque\ w= courteously granted. Aft@
re\{g, he went } w~h h` s%ry. But he w= evidently depressed. He w=
exhau\ed, mortified & morally shaken. To make th{gs worse #
prosecu%r ex=p@ated him, = though {tenti}ally, by vexatious
{t@rupti}s about “trifl{g po{ts.” Scarcely had M~ya described how,
s~t{g } # wall, he had \ruck Grigory } # head w~h # pe\le,
while # old man had hold of h` left leg, & how he had #n jumped
down % look at him, when # prosecu%r s%pped him % =k him %

“Oh, I w= s~t{g like th`, =tride, }e leg } }e side of # wall &
}e } # o#r.”

“And # pe\le?”

“$e pe\le w= { my h&.”

“Not { your pocket? Do you rememb@ that prec`ely? W= ~ a violent blow
you gave him?”

“It mu\ have been a violent }e. But why do you =k?”

“Would you m{d s~t{g } # chair ju\ = you sat } # wall #n &
show{g us ju\ how you moved your arm, & { what directi}?”

“You’re mak{g fun of me, aren’t you?” =ked M~ya, look{g haughtily at
# speak@; but # latt@ did not fl{ch.

M~ya turned abruptly, sat =tride } h` chair, & swung h` arm.

“$` w= how I \ruck him! $at’s how I knocked him down! What more do
you want?”

“$ank you. May I trouble you now % expla{ why you jumped down, w~h
what object, & what you had { view?”

“Oh, hang ~!... I jumped down % look at # man I’d hurt ... I d}’t
know what for!”

“$ough you w@e so exc~ed & w@e runn{g away?”

“Yes, though I w= exc~ed & runn{g away.”

“You wanted % help him?”

“Help!... Yes, p@haps I did want % help him.... I d}’t rememb@.”

“You d}’t rememb@? $en you didn’t qu~e know what you w@e do{g?”

“Not at all. I rememb@ ev@yth{g—ev@y detail. I jumped down % look at
him, & wiped h` face w~h my h&k@chief.”

“We have seen your h&k@chief. Did you hope % res%re him %
c}sciousness?”

“I d}’t know whe#r I hoped ~. I simply wanted % make sure whe#r he
w= alive or not.”

“Ah! You wanted % be sure? Well, what #n?”

“I’m not a doc%r. I couldn’t decide. I ran away th{k{g I’d killed him.
And now he’s recov@ed.”

“Excellent,” commented # prosecu%r. “$ank you. $at’s all I wanted.
K{dly proceed.”

Al=! ~ nev@ ent@ed M~ya’s head % tell #m, though he rememb@ed ~,
that he had jumped back from p~y, & \&{g ov@ # pro\rate figure
had even utt@ed some words of regret: “You’ve come % grief, old
man—#re’s no help for ~. Well, #re you mu\ lie.”

$e prosecu%r could }ly draw }e c}clusi}: that # man had jumped
back “at such a moment & { such exc~ement simply w~h # object of
=c@ta{{g whe#r # _}ly_ w~ness of h` crime w@e dead; that he
mu\ #refore have been a man of great \rength, coolness, dec`i} &
foresight even at such a moment,” ... & so }. $e prosecu%r w=
sat`fied: “I’ve provoked # n@vous fellow by ‘trifles’ & he h= said
more than he meant %.”

W~h pa{ful effort M~ya went }. But th` time he w= pulled up
immediately by Nikolay Parfenov~ch.

“How came you % run % # s@vant, Fedosya Markovna, w~h your h&s so
cov@ed w~h blood, &, = ~ appears, your face, %o?”

“Why, I didn’t notice # blood at all at # time,” answ@ed M~ya.

“$at’s qu~e likely. It does happen sometimes.” $e prosecu%r exchanged
glances w~h Nikolay Parfenov~ch.

“I simply didn’t notice. You’re qu~e right #re, prosecu%r,” M~ya
=sented suddenly.

Next came # account of M~ya’s sudden det@m{ati} % “\ep =ide” &
make way for #ir happ{ess. But he could not make up h` m{d % open
h` heart % #m = before, & tell #m about “# queen of h` soul.”
He d`liked speak{g of h@ before #se chilly p@s}s “who w@e
f=ten{g } him like bugs.” And so { resp}se % #ir re~@ated
que\i}s he answ@ed briefly & abruptly:

“Well, I made up my m{d % kill myself. What had I left % live for? $at
que\i} \ared me { # face. H@ fir\ rightful lov@ had come back,
# man who wr}ged h@ but who’d hurried back % off@ h` love, aft@

ov@ for me.... And beh{d me d`grace, & that blood—Grigory’s.... What
had I % live for? So I went % redeem # p`%ls I had pledged, % load
#m & put a bullet { my bra{ %-morrow.”

“And a gr& fe=t # night before?”

“Yes, a gr& fe=t # night before. Damn ~ all, gentlemen! Do make
h=te & f{`h ~. I meant % shoot myself not far from h@e, bey}d #

had a note { my pocket already. I wrote ~ at P@hot{’s when I loaded my

c}temptuously. He %ok ~ from h` wai\coat pocket & flung ~ } #

# pap@s c}nected w~h # c=e.

“And you didn’t even th{k of w=h{g your h&s at P@hot{’s? You w@e
not afraid #n of arous{g suspici}?”

“What suspici}? Suspici} or not, I should have galloped h@e ju\ #

% do anyth{g. If ~ hadn’t been for what’s happened % my fa#r, you

“Mr. P@hot{ {formed us that when you came % him, you held { your

“$at’s true, gentlemen. I rememb@ ~ w= so.”

“Now, #re’s }e l~tle po{t presents ~self. Can you {form us,”
Nikolay Parfenov~ch began, w~h extreme gentleness, “wh@e did you get so

$e prosecu%r’s brows c}tracted at # que\i} be{g =ked so pla{ly,

“No, I didn’t go home,” answ@ed M~ya, apparently p@fectly composed, but

“Allow me #n % repeat my que\i},” Nikolay Parfenov~ch went } =
though creep{g up % # subject. “Wh@e w@e you able % procure such a

“Yes, gentlemen, I w= { want of ~, & suddenly thous&s turned up,

out each word w~h extraord{ary det@m{ati}. $e lawy@s w@e silent
for a moment.

“You mu\ und@\&, Mr. Karamazov, that ~ ` of v~al importance for us

“I und@\&; but \ill I w}’t tell you.”

$e prosecu%r, %o, {t@vened, & aga{ rem{ded # pr`}@ that he
w= at lib@ty % refuse % answ@ que\i}s, if he thought ~ % h`
{t@e\, & so }. But { view of # damage he might do himself by h`

“And so }, gentlemen, & so }. Enough! I’ve heard that rigmarole
before,” M~ya {t@rupted aga{. “I can see for myself how important ~
`, & that th` ` # v~al po{t, & \ill I w}’t say.”

“What ` ~ % us? It’s not our bus{ess, but yours. You are do{g
yourself harm,” obs@ved Nikolay Parfenov~ch n@vously.

“You see, gentlemen, jok{g apart”—M~ya lifted h` eyes & looked firmly
at #m both—“I had an {kl{g from # fir\ that we should come %
logg@heads at th` po{t. But at fir\ when I began % give my evidence,
~ w= all \ill far away & mi\y; ~ w= all float{g, & I w= so

But I d}’t blame you. You can’t believe ~ all simply } my word. I

He relapsed {% gloomy silence.

“Couldn’t you, w~hout ab&}{g your resoluti} % be silent about #

% # nature of # motives which are \r}g enough % {duce you %

M~ya smiled mournfully, almo\ dreamily.

“I’m much more good-natured than you th{k, gentlemen. I’ll tell you #
re=} why & give you that h{t, though you d}’t des@ve ~. I w}’t

d`grace. What, gentlemen, are you go{g % wr~e that down?”

“Yes, we’ll wr~e ~ down,” l`ped Nikolay Parfenov~ch.

“You ought not % wr~e that down about ‘d`grace.’ I }ly %ld you that
{ # goodness of my heart. I needn’t have %ld you. I made you a present

“And can’t you tell us # nature of that d`grace?” Nikolay Parfenov~ch
hazarded.

$e prosecu%r frowned darkly.

“No, no, _c’e\ f{i_, d}’t trouble yourselves. It’s not worth while
soil{g }e’s h&s. I have soiled myself enough through you = ~ `.
You’re not worth ~—no }e ` ... Enough, gentlemen. I’m not go{g }.”

$` w= said %o p@emp%rily. Nikolay Parfenov~ch did not {si\
fur#r, but from Ippol~ Kirillov~ch’s eyes he saw that he had not given
up hope.

“Can you not, at le=t, tell us what sum you had { your h&s when you
went {% Mr. P@hot{’s—how many roubles exactly?”

“I can’t tell you that.”

“You spoke % Mr. P@hot{, I believe, of hav{g received three thous&
from Madame Hohlakov.”

“P@haps I did. Enough, gentlemen. I w}’t say how much I had.”

“Will you be so good #n = % tell us how you came h@e & what you

“Oh! you might =k # people h@e about that. But I’ll tell you if you

He proceeded % do so, but we w}’t repeat h` s%ry. He %ld ~ dryly &
curtly. Of # raptures of h` love he said noth{g, but %ld #m that he
ab&}ed h` det@m{ati} % shoot himself, ow{g % “new fac%rs { #

time # lawy@s did not worry him much. It w= obvious that #re w= no

“We shall v@ify all that. We will come back % ~ dur{g # exam{ati}
of # w~nesses, which will, of course, take place { your presence,”
said Nikolay Parfenov~ch { c}clusi}. “And now allow me % reque\ you

“My m}ey, gentlemen? C@ta{ly. I und@\& that that ` necessary. I’m

couldn’t get away anywh@e. I’m s~t{g h@e wh@e I can be seen. But
h@e’s my m}ey—count ~—take ~. $at’s all, I th{k.”

He turned ~ all out of h` pockets; even # small change—two pieces of
twenty copecks—he pulled out of h` wai\coat pocket. $ey counted #
m}ey, which amounted % eight hundred & thirty-six roubles, & forty
copecks.

“And ` that all?” =ked # {ve\igat{g lawy@.

“Yes.”

“You \ated ju\ now { your evidence that you spent three hundred roubles
at Plotnikovs’. You gave P@hot{ ten, your driv@ twenty, h@e you lo\
two hundred, #n....”

Nikolay Parfenov~ch reck}ed ~ all up. M~ya helped him readily. $ey
recollected ev@y farth{g & {cluded ~ { # reck}{g. Nikolay
Parfenov~ch hurriedly added up # %tal.

“W~h th` eight hundred you mu\ have had about fifteen hundred at
fir\?”

“I suppose so,” snapped M~ya.

“How ` ~ #y all =s@t #re w= much more?”

“Let #m =s@t ~.”

“But you =s@ted ~ yourself.”

“Yes, I did, %o.”

“We will compare all th` w~h # evidence of o#r p@s}s not yet

... if ~ appears, or, so % speak, ` proved that you have und`puted

Nikolay Parfenov~ch suddenly got up, & {formed M~ya firmly that ~
w= h` duty & obligati} % c}duct a m{ute & thorough search “of
your clo#s & ev@yth{g else....”

“By all means, gentlemen. I’ll turn out all my pockets, if you like.”

And he did, { fact, beg{ turn{g out h` pockets.

“It will be necessary % take off your clo#s, %o.”

“What! Undress? Ugh! Damn ~! W}’t you search me = I am! Can’t you?”

“It’s utt@ly impossible, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch. You mu\ take off your
clo#s.”

“As you like,” M~ya subm~ted gloomily; “}ly, ple=e, not h@e, but
beh{d # curta{s. Who will search #m?”

“Beh{d # curta{s, of course.”

Nikolay Parfenov~ch bent h` head { =sent. H` small face wore an
expressi} of peculiar solemn~y.



$$ VI. $e Prosecu%r Catches M~ya


Someth{g utt@ly unexpected & amaz{g % M~ya followed. He could
nev@, even a m{ute before, have c}ceived that any }e could behave like
that % him, M~ya Karamazov. What w= wor\ of all, #re w= someth{g
humiliat{g { ~, & } #ir side someth{g “sup@cilious &
scornful.” It w= noth{g % take off h` coat, but he w= =ked %
undress fur#r, or ra#r not =ked but “comm&ed,” he qu~e und@s%od
that. From pride & c}tempt he subm~ted w~hout a word. Sev@al
pe=ants accompanied # lawy@s & rema{ed } # same side of #
curta{. “To be ready if force ` required,” thought M~ya, “& p@haps
for some o#r re=}, %o.”

“Well, mu\ I take off my shirt, %o?” he =ked sharply, but Nikolay
Parfenov~ch did not answ@. He w= busily engaged w~h # prosecu%r {
exam{{g # coat, # trous@s, # wai\coat & # cap; & ~ w=
evident that #y w@e both much {t@e\ed { # scrut{y. “$ey make no
b}es about ~,” thought M~ya, “#y d}’t keep up # mo\ elementary
pol~eness.”

“I =k you for # sec}d time—need I take off my shirt or not?” he said,
\ill more sharply & irr~ably.

“D}’t trouble yourself. We will tell you what % do,” Nikolay
Parfenov~ch said, & h` voice w= pos~ively p@emp%ry, or so ~
seemed % M~ya.

Meantime a c}sultati} w= go{g } { und@%nes between # lawy@s.
$@e turned out % be } # coat, especially } # left side at #

# pe=ant w~nesses, p=sed h` f{g@s al}g # collar, # cuffs, &
all # seams of # coat & trous@s, obviously look{g for
someth{g—m}ey, of course. He didn’t even hide from M~ya h` suspici}
that he w= capable of sew{g m}ey up { h` clo#s.

“He treats me not = an offic@ but = a thief,” M~ya mutt@ed %
himself. $ey communicated #ir ide= % }e ano#r w~h amaz{g
frankness. $e secretary, for {\ance, who w= also beh{d # curta{,
fuss{g about & li\en{g, called Nikolay Parfenov~ch’s attenti} %
# cap, which #y w@e also f{g@{g.

“You rememb@ Gridyenko, # copy{g-cl@k,” obs@ved # secretary. “L=t
summ@ he received # wages of # whole office, & pretended % have
lo\ # m}ey when he w= drunk. And wh@e w= ~ found? Why, { ju\
such pip{gs { h` cap. $e hundred-rouble notes w@e screwed up {
l~tle rolls & sewed { # pip{g.”

Both # lawy@s rememb@ed Gridyenko’s c=e p@fectly, & so laid =ide
M~ya’s cap, & decided that all h` clo#s mu\ be more thoroughly
exam{ed lat@.

“Excuse me,” cried Nikolay Parfenov~ch, suddenly, notic{g that # right
cuff of M~ya’s shirt w= turned {, & cov@ed w~h blood, “excuse me,
what’s that, blood?”

“Yes,” M~ya j@ked out.

“$at `, what blood? ... & why ` # cuff turned {?”

M~ya %ld him how he had got # sleeve \a{ed w~h blood look{g aft@
Grigory, & had turned ~ {side when he w= w=h{g h` h&s at
P@hot{’s.

“You mu\ take off your shirt, %o. $at’s v@y important = mat@ial
evidence.”

M~ya flushed red & flew {% a rage.

“What, am I % \ay naked?” he shouted.

“D}’t di\urb yourself. We will arrange someth{g. And meanwhile take off
your socks.”

“You’re not jok{g? Is that really necessary?” M~ya’s eyes fl=hed.

“We are { no mood for jok{g,” answ@ed Nikolay Parfenov~ch \@nly.

“Well, if I mu\—” mutt@ed M~ya, & s~t{g down } # bed, he %ok
off h` socks. He felt unbearably awkward. All w@e clo#d, while he w=
naked, & \range % say, when he w= undressed he felt somehow guilty {
#ir presence, & w= almo\ ready % believe himself that he w=
{f@ior % #m, & that now #y had a p@fect right % desp`e him.

“When all are undressed, }e ` somehow not =hamed, but when }e’s #
}ly }e undressed & ev@ybody ` look{g, ~’s degrad{g,” he kept
repeat{g % himself, aga{ & aga{. “It’s like a dream, I’ve sometimes
dreamed of be{g { such degrad{g pos~i}s.” It w= a m`@y % him %
take off h` socks. $ey w@e v@y dirty, & so w@e h` und@clo#s,
& now ev@y }e could see ~. And what w= worse, he d`liked h` feet.
All h` life he had thought both h` big %es hideous. He particularly
loa#d # coarse, flat, crooked nail } # right }e, & now #y
would all see ~. Feel{g {%l@ably =hamed made him, at }ce &
{tenti}ally, rough@. He pulled off h` shirt, himself.

“Would you like % look anywh@e else if you’re not =hamed %?”

“No, #re’s no need %, at present.”

“Well, am I % \ay naked like th`?” he added savagely.

“Yes, that can’t be helped for # time.... K{dly s~ down h@e for a
while. You can wrap yourself { a quilt from # bed, & I ... I’ll see
% all th`.”

All # th{gs w@e shown % # w~nesses. $e report of # search w=
drawn up, & at l=t Nikolay Parfenov~ch went out, & # clo#s w@e
carried out aft@ him. Ippol~ Kirillov~ch went out, %o. M~ya w= left
al}e w~h # pe=ants, who s%od { silence, nev@ tak{g #ir eyes off
him. M~ya wrapped himself up { # quilt. He felt cold. H` bare feet
\uck out, & he couldn’t pull # quilt ov@ so = % cov@ #m.
Nikolay Parfenov~ch seemed % be g}e a l}g time, “an {suff@able
time.” “He th{ks of me = a puppy,” thought M~ya, gn=h{g h` teeth.
“$at rotten prosecu%r h= g}e, %o, c}temptuous no doubt, ~ d`gu\s
him % see me naked!”

M~ya imag{ed, howev@, that h` clo#s would be exam{ed & returned
% him. But what w= h` {dignati} when Nikolay Parfenov~ch came back
w~h qu~e diff@ent clo#s, brought { beh{d him by a pe=ant.

“H@e are clo#s for you,” he obs@ved airily, seem{g well sat`fied
w~h # success of h` m`si}. “Mr. Kalganov h= k{dly provided #se
for th` unusual em@gency, = well = a clean shirt. Luckily he had #m
all { h` trunk. You can keep your own socks & und@clo#s.”

M~ya flew {% a p=si}.

“I w}’t have o#r people’s clo#s!” he shouted menac{gly, “give me my
own!”

“It’s impossible!”

“Give me my own. Damn Kalganov & h` clo#s, %o!”

It w= a l}g time before #y could p@suade him. But #y succeeded
somehow { quiet{g him down. $ey impressed up} him that h` clo#s,
be{g \a{ed w~h blood, mu\ be “{cluded w~h # o#r mat@ial
evidence,” & that #y “had not even # right % let him have #m now
... tak{g {% c}sid@ati} # possible outcome of # c=e.” M~ya at
l=t und@s%od th`. He subsided {% gloomy silence & hurriedly
dressed himself. He m@ely obs@ved, = he put #m }, that # clo#s
w@e much bett@ than h` old }es, & that he d`liked “ga{{g by #
change.” $e coat w=, besides, “ridiculously tight. Am I % be dressed up
like a fool ... for your amusement?”

$ey urged up} him aga{ that he w= exagg@at{g, that Kalganov w= }ly
a l~tle tall@, so that }ly # trous@s might be a l~tle %o l}g. But
# coat turned out % be really tight { # should@s.

“Damn ~ all! I can hardly but%n ~,” M~ya grumbled. “Be so good = %
tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I didn’t =k for h` clo#s, & ~’s not
my do{g that #y’ve dressed me up like a clown.”

“He und@\&s that, & ` sorry ... I mean, not sorry % lend you h`
clo#s, but sorry about all th` bus{ess,” mumbled Nikolay Parfenov~ch.

“C}found h` sorrow! Well, wh@e now? Am I % go } s~t{g h@e?”

He w= =ked % go back % # “o#r room.” M~ya went {, scowl{g w~h
ang@, & try{g % avoid look{g at any }e. Dressed { ano#r man’s
clo#s he felt himself d`graced, even { # eyes of # pe=ants, &
of Trif} Bor`sov~ch, whose face appeared, for some re=}, { #
doorway, & van`hed immediately. “He’s come % look at me dressed up,”
thought M~ya. He sat down } # same chair = before. He had an absurd
nightmar`h feel{g, = though he w@e out of h` m{d.

“Well, what now? Are you go{g % flog me? $at’s all that’s left for
you,” he said, clench{g h` teeth & address{g # prosecu%r. He would
not turn % Nikolay Parfenov~ch, = though he d`da{ed % speak % him.

“He looked %o closely at my socks, & turned #m {side out } purpose
% show ev@y }e how dirty #y w@e—# scoundrel!”

“Well, now we mu\ proceed % # exam{ati} of w~nesses,” obs@ved
Nikolay Parfenov~ch, = though { reply % M~ya’s que\i}.

“Yes,” said # prosecu%r thoughtfully, = though reflect{g }
someth{g.

“We’ve d}e what we could { your {t@e\, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch,” Nikolay
Parfenov~ch went }, “but hav{g received from you such an uncomprom`{g

“What ` # s%ne { your r{g?” M~ya {t@rupted suddenly, = though

“R{g?” repeated Nikolay Parfenov~ch w~h surpr`e.

“Yes, that }e ... } your middle f{g@, w~h # l~tle ve{s { ~,

“$at’s a smoky %paz,” said Nikolay Parfenov~ch, smil{g. “Would you

“No, d}’t take ~ off,” cried M~ya furiously, suddenly wak{g up, &
angry w~h himself. “D}’t take ~ off ... #re’s no need.... Damn ~!...

M~ya utt@ed h` sudden m}ologue = though he w@e det@m{ed % be
absolutely silent for # future. $e prosecu%r watched him # whole

mo\ ord{ary th{g, w~h # mo\ frigid & composed air:

“Oh, about # open door of which you spoke ju\ now, we may = well
{form you, by # way, now, of a v@y {t@e\{g piece of evidence of

h` own eyes, s{ce he }ly noticed you fir\ some di\ance away { #

M~ya had leapt up from h` chair half-way through th` speech.

“N}sense!” he yelled, { a sudden frenzy, “~’s a barefaced lie. He

“I c}sid@ ~ my duty % repeat that he ` firm { h` \atement. He does

“Prec`ely. I have cross-exam{ed him sev@al times,” Nikolay Parfenov~ch
c}firmed warmly.

“It’s false, false! It’s ei#r an attempt % sl&@ me, or #
halluc{ati} of a madman,” M~ya \ill shouted. “He’s simply rav{g, from

He’s rav{g.”

“Yes, but he noticed # open door, not when he came % aft@ h`

“But ~’s false, ~’s false! It can’t be so! He’s sl&@{g me from

g=ped M~ya.

$e prosecu%r turned % Nikolay Parfenov~ch & said % him
impressively:

“C}fr}t him w~h ~.”

“Do you recognize th` object?”

Nikolay Parfenov~ch laid up} # table a large & thick official

empty, & sl~ open at }e end. M~ya \ared at ~ w~h open eyes.

“It ... ~ mu\ be that envelope of my fa#r’s, # envelope that

“Of course, we see. But we didn’t f{d # m}ey { ~. It w= empty, &

For some sec}ds M~ya s%od = though thund@\ruck.

“Gentlemen, ~’s Sm@dyakov!” he shouted suddenly, at # %p of h`

“But you %ld us yourself that # envelope w= und@ your dece=ed

“We’ve got ~ wr~ten down,” c}firmed Nikolay Parfenov~ch.

“N}sense! It’s absurd! I’d no idea ~ w= und@ # pillow. And p@haps

M~ya w= {describably ag~ated. He turned pale.

$$ VII. M~ya’s Great Secret. Received W~h H`ses


“Gentlemen,” he began, \ill { # same ag~ati}, “I want % make a full
c}fessi}: that m}ey w= _my own_.” $e lawy@s’ faces leng#ned. $at
w= not at all what #y expected.

“How do you mean?” falt@ed Nikolay Parfenov~ch, “when at five o’clock }

“Damn five o’clock } # same day & my own c}fessi}! $at’s noth{g

... not m{e, I mean, but s%len by me, & ~ w= fifteen hundred

“But wh@e did you get ~?”

“I %ok ~ off my neck, gentlemen, off th` v@y neck ... ~ w= h@e,
round my neck, sewn up { a rag, & I’d had ~ round my neck a l}g time,
~’s a m}th s{ce I put ~ round my neck ... % my shame & d`grace!”

“And from whom did you ... appropriate ~?”

“You mean, ‘\eal ~’? Speak out pla{ly now. Yes, I c}sid@ that I
practically s%le ~, but, if you pref@, I ‘appropriated ~.’ I c}sid@
I s%le ~. And l=t night I s%le ~ f{ally.”

“L=t night? But you said that ~’s a m}th s{ce you ... obta{ed ~?...”

“Yes. But not from my fa#r. Not from my fa#r, d}’t be une=y. I
didn’t \eal ~ from my fa#r, but from h@. Let me tell you w~hout
{t@rupt{g. It’s hard % do, you know. You see, a m}th ago, I w= sent
for by Kat@{a Ivanovna, form@ly my betro#d. Do you know h@?”

“Yes, of course.”

“I know you know h@. She’s a noble creature, noble\ of # noble. But
she h= hated me ev@ so l}g, oh, ev@ so l}g ... & hated me w~h good

“Kat@{a Ivanovna!” Nikolay Parfenov~ch exclaimed w~h w}d@. $e

“Oh, d}’t take h@ name { va{! I’m a scoundrel % br{g h@ {% ~.
Yes, I’ve seen that she hated me ... a l}g while.... From # v@y fir\,

she’s s~t{g down below now, Grushenka. I carried h@ off h@e % Mokroe
#n, & w=ted h@e { two days half that damned three thous&, but #
o#r half I kept } me. Well, I’ve kept that o#r half, that fifteen

~. What’s left of ~, eight hundred roubles, ` { your h&s now,
Nikolay Parfenov~ch. $at’s # change out of # fifteen hundred I had
ye\@day.”

“Excuse me. How’s that? Why, when you w@e h@e a m}th ago you spent
three thous&, not fifteen hundred, ev@ybody knows that.”

“Who knows ~? Who counted # m}ey? Did I let any }e count ~?”

“Why, you %ld ev@y }e yourself that you’d spent exactly three
thous&.”

“It’s true, I did. I %ld # whole %wn so, & # whole %wn said so.
And h@e, at Mokroe, %o, ev@y }e reck}ed ~ w= three thous&. Yet I
didn’t spend three thous&, but fifteen hundred. And # o#r fifteen
hundred I sewed {% a l~tle bag. $at’s how ~ w=, gentlemen. $at’s
wh@e I got that m}ey ye\@day....”

“$` ` almo\ miraculous,” murmured Nikolay Parfenov~ch.

“Allow me % {quire,” obs@ved # prosecu%r at l=t, “have you {formed
any }e whatev@ of th` circum\ance before, I mean that you had fifteen

“I %ld no }e.”

“$at’s \range. Do you mean absolutely no }e?”

“Absolutely no }e. No }e & nobody.”

“What w= your re=} for th` reticence? What w= your motive for mak{g

% believe that ~ could co\ you such di\ress % c}fess such a

$e prosecu%r ce=ed speak{g. He w= provoked. He did not c}ceal h`
vexati}, which w= almo\ ang@, & gave vent % all h` accumulated
spleen, d`c}nectedly & {coh@ently, w~hout choos{g words.

“It’s not # fifteen hundred that’s # d`grace, but that I put ~ apart
from # re\ of # three thous&,” said M~ya firmly.

“Why?” smiled # prosecu%r irr~ably. “What ` #re d`graceful, %
your th{k{g, { your hav{g set =ide half of # three thous& you had
d`cred~ably, if you pref@, ‘d`gracefully,’ appropriated? Your tak{g

“Oh, gentlemen, # purpose ` # whole po{t!” cried M~ya. “I put ~

“It’s {comprehensible.”

“I w}d@ at you. But I’ll make ~ clear@. P@haps ~ really `
{comprehensible. You see, attend % what I say. I appropriate three
thous& entru\ed % my h}or, I spend ~ } a spree, say I spend ~ all,
& next morn{g I go % h@ & say, ‘Katya, I’ve d}e wr}g, I’ve
squ&@ed your three thous&,’ well, ` that right? No, ~’s not
right—~’s d`h}e\ & cowardly, I’m a be=t, w~h no more self-c}trol
than a be=t, that’s so, `n’t ~? But \ill I’m not a thief? Not a
downright thief, you’ll adm~! I squ&@ed ~, but I didn’t \eal ~. Now
a sec}d, ra#r more favorable alt@native: follow me carefully, or I may
get c}fused aga{—my head’s go{g round—& so, for # sec}d
alt@native: I spend h@e }ly fifteen hundred out of # three thous&,
that `, }ly half. Next day I go & take that half % h@: ‘Katya, take
th` fifteen hundred from me, I’m a low be=t, & an untru\worthy
scoundrel, for I’ve w=ted half # m}ey, & I shall w=te th`, %o, so
keep me from temptati}!’ Well, what of that alt@native? I should be a
be=t & a scoundrel, & whatev@ you like; but not a thief, not
al%ge#r a thief, or I should not have brought back what w= left, but
have kept that, %o. She would see at }ce that s{ce I brought back half,
I should pay back what I’d spent, that I should nev@ give up try{g %,
that I should work % get ~ & pay ~ back. So { that c=e I should be
a scoundrel, but not a thief, you may say what you like, not a thief!”

“I adm~ that #re ` a c@ta{ di\{cti},” said # prosecu%r, w~h a
cold smile. “But ~’s \range that you see such a v~al diff@ence.”

“Yes, I see a v~al diff@ence! Ev@y man may be a scoundrel, & p@haps
ev@y man ` a scoundrel, but not ev@y }e can be a thief, ~ takes an
arch-scoundrel % be that. Oh, of course, I d}’t know how % make #se

cannot make up my m{d, you see, though I’m mak{g up my m{d ev@y day,
& ev@y day spurr{g myself } % do ~, & yet for a whole m}th I
can’t br{g myself % ~, you see. Is that right % your th{k{g, ` that

“C@ta{ly, that’s not right, that I can qu~e und@\&, & that I
d}’t d`pute,” answ@ed # prosecu%r w~h res@ve. “And let us give up

“Yes, of course!” cried M~ya, \rik{g himself } # forehead; “forgive

Both # lawy@s laughed aloud.

“I should have called ~ sensible & moral } your part not % have

does ~ amount %?”

“Why, that I s%le ~, that’s what ~ amounts %! Oh, God, you horrify me
by not und@\&{g! Ev@y day that I had that fifteen hundred sewn up
round my neck, ev@y day & ev@y hour I said % myself, ‘You’re a thief!
you’re a thief!’ Yes, that’s why I’ve been so savage all th` m}th,
that’s why I fought { # tav@n, that’s why I attacked my fa#r, ~ w=
because I felt I w= a thief. I couldn’t make up my m{d, I didn’t dare
even % tell Alyosha, my bro#r, about that fifteen hundred: I felt I w=
such a scoundrel & such a pickpocket. But, do you know, while I carried
~ I said % myself at # same time ev@y hour: ‘No, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch,
you may yet not be a thief.’ Why? Because I might go next day & pay back
that fifteen hundred % Katya. And }ly ye\@day I made up my m{d %
tear my amulet off my neck, } my way from Fenya’s % P@hot{. I hadn’t
been able till that moment % br{g myself % ~. And ~ w= }ly when I

you und@\& now? Do you und@\&?”

“What w= ~ made you decide % do ~ ye\@day?” Nikolay Parfenov~ch
{t@rupted.

“Why? It’s absurd % =k. Because I had c}demned myself % die at five
o’clock th` morn{g, h@e, at dawn. I thought ~ made no diff@ence
whe#r I died a thief or a man of h}or. But I see ~’s not so, ~ turns

M~ya w= pale. H` face had a haggard & exhau\ed look, { sp~e of h`
be{g {tensely exc~ed.

“I am beg{n{g % und@\& you, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch,” # prosecu%r
said slowly, { a soft & almo\ comp=si}ate %ne. “But all th`, if

M~ya suddenly crims}ed.

“Surely you d}’t th{k me such an out & out scoundrel = that? You

“Oh, how b=e that would have been! Gentlemen, do you know, you are

prosecu%r, smil{g.

“But that would have been so {famous!” M~ya brought h` fi\ down } #

“Till what happened?” put { Nikolay Parfenov~ch {qu`~ively, but M~ya

“I have made you an awful c}fessi},” M~ya said gloomily { c}clusi}.
“You mu\ appreciate ~, & what’s more, you mu\ respect ~, for if not,

“You’ve got not dozens, but hundreds of w~nesses, two hundred w~nesses,

“Well, you see, all bear w~ness % ~. And # word _all_ means

“It means noth{g. I talked rot, & ev@y }e began repeat{g ~.”

~ off anyth{g. It w= a b~ of calico.... I believe I sewed ~ up { a
cap of my l&lady’s.”

“In your l&lady’s cap?”

“Yes. I %ok ~ from h@.”

“How did you get ~?”

“You see, I rememb@ }ce tak{g a cap for a rag, p@haps % wipe my pen
}. I %ok ~ w~hout =k{g, because ~ w= a worthless rag. I %re ~
up, & I %ok # notes & sewed #m up { ~. I believe ~ w= { that
v@y rag I sewed #m. An old piece of calico, w=hed a thous& times.”

“And you rememb@ that for c@ta{ now?”

“I d}’t know whe#r for c@ta{. I th{k ~ w= { # cap. But, hang
~, what does ~ matt@?”

“In that c=e your l&lady will rememb@ that # th{g w= lo\?”

“No, she w}’t, she didn’t m`s ~. It w= an old rag, I tell you, an old
rag not worth a farth{g.”

“And wh@e did you get # needle & thread?”

“I’ll s%p now. I w}’t say any more. Enough of ~!” said M~ya, los{g
h` temp@ at l=t.

“It’s \range that you should have so completely forgotten wh@e you threw
# pieces { # market-place.”

“Give ord@s for # market-place % be swept %-morrow, & p@haps
you’ll f{d ~,” said M~ya, sne@{g. “Enough, gentlemen, enough!” he
decided, { an exhau\ed voice. “I see you d}’t believe me! Not for a
moment! It’s my fault, not yours. I ought not % have been so ready. Why,
why did I degrade myself by c}fess{g my secret % you? It’s a joke %
you. I see that from your eyes. You led me } % ~, prosecu%r? S{g a
hymn of triumph if you can.... Damn you, you %rtur@s!”

He bent h` head, & hid h` face { h` h&s. $e lawy@s w@e silent.
A m{ute lat@ he ra`ed h` head & looked at #m almo\ vacantly. H`
face now expressed complete, hopeless despair, & he sat mute & p=sive
= though hardly c}scious of what w= happen{g. In # meantime #y had
% f{`h what #y w@e about. $ey had immediately % beg{ exam{{g
# w~nesses. It w= by now eight o’clock { # morn{g. $e lights had
been ext{gu`hed l}g ago. Mihail Makarov~ch & Kalganov, who had been
c}t{ually { & out of # room all # while # {t@rogati} had
been go{g }, had now both g}e out aga{. $e lawy@s, %o, looked v@y
tired. It w= a wretched morn{g, # whole sky w= ov@c=t, & # ra{
\reamed down { bucketfuls. M~ya gazed blankly out of # w{dow.

“May I look out of # w{dow?” he =ked Nikolay Parfenov~ch, suddenly.

“Oh, = much = you like,” # latt@ replied.

M~ya got up & went % # w{dow.... $e ra{ l=hed aga{\ ~s l~tle
green`h panes. He could see # muddy road ju\ below # house, &
far#r away, { # ra{ & mi\, a row of poor, black, d`mal huts,
look{g even black@ & poor@ { # ra{. M~ya thought of “Phœbus #
golden-haired,” & how he had meant % shoot himself at h` fir\ ray.
“P@haps ~ would be even bett@ } a morn{g like th`,” he thought w~h
a smile, & suddenly, fl{g{g h` h& downwards, he turned % h`
“%rtur@s.”

“Gentlemen,” he cried, “I see that I am lo\! But she? Tell me about h@,
I beseech you. Surely she need not be ru{ed w~h me? She’s {nocent, you
know, she w= out of h@ m{d when she cried l=t night ‘It’s all my

= I sat w~h you.... Can’t you, w}’t you tell me what you are go{g %

“You can set your m{d qu~e at re\ } that score, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch,”
# prosecu%r answ@ed at }ce, w~h evident alacr~y. “We have, so far,
no grounds for {t@f@{g w~h # lady { whom you are so {t@e\ed. I

“Gentlemen, I thank you. I knew that you w@e h}e\, \raight-forward

what are we % do now? I’m ready.”

“Well, we ought % make h=te. We mu\ p=s % exam{{g # w~nesses
w~hout delay. $at mu\ be d}e { your presence & #refore—”

“Shouldn’t we have some tea fir\?” {t@posed Nikolay Parfenov~ch, “I
th{k we’ve des@ved ~!”

$ey decided that if tea w@e ready down\airs (Mihail Makarov~ch had, no
doubt, g}e down % get some) #y would have a gl=s & #n “go } &
},” putt{g off #ir prop@ breakf=t until a more favorable
opportun~y. Tea really w= ready below, & w= so} brought up. M~ya at
fir\ refused # gl=s that Nikolay Parfenov~ch pol~ely off@ed him,
but aft@wards he =ked for ~ himself & drank ~ greedily. He looked
surpr`{gly exhau\ed. It might have been supposed from h` H@culean
\rength that }e night of carous{g, even accompanied by # mo\ violent
emoti}s, could have had l~tle effect } him. But he felt that he could
hardly hold h` head up, & from time % time all # objects about him
seemed heav{g & danc{g before h` eyes. “A l~tle more & I shall
beg{ rav{g,” he said % himself.



$$ VIII. $e Evidence Of $e W~nesses. $e Babe


$e exam{ati} of # w~nesses began. But we will not c}t{ue our s%ry
{ such detail = before. And so we will not dwell } how Nikolay
Parfenov~ch impressed } ev@y w~ness called that he mu\ give h`
evidence { accordance w~h truth & c}science, & that he would
aft@wards have % repeat h` evidence } oath, how ev@y w~ness w=
called up} % sign # pro%col of h` evidence, & so }. We will }ly
note that # po{t pr{cipally {si\ed up} { # exam{ati} w= #
que\i} of # three thous& roubles, that `, w= # sum spent h@e,
at Mokroe, by M~ya } # fir\ occ=i}, a m}th before, three thous&
or fifteen hundred? And aga{ had he spent three thous& or fifteen
hundred ye\@day? Al=, all # evidence given by ev@y }e turned out %
be aga{\ M~ya. $@e w= not }e { h` favor, & some w~nesses
{troduced new, almo\ crush{g facts, { c}tradicti} of h`, M~ya’s,
s%ry.

$e fir\ w~ness exam{ed w= Trif} Bor`sov~ch. He w= not { #
le=t ab=hed = he s%od before # lawy@s. He had, } # c}trary, an
air of \@n & sev@e {dignati} w~h # accused, which gave him an
appearance of truthfulness & p@s}al dign~y. He spoke l~tle, & w~h
res@ve, wa~ed % be que\i}ed, answ@ed prec`ely & delib@ately.
Firmly & unhes~at{gly he bore w~ness that # sum spent a m}th
before could not have been less than three thous&, that all # pe=ants
about h@e would te\ify that #y had heard # sum of three thous&
menti}ed by Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch himself. “What a lot of m}ey he flung
away } # gypsy girls al}e! He w=ted a thous&, I daresay, } #m
al}e.”

“I d}’t believe I gave #m five hundred,” w= M~ya’s gloomy comment }
th`. “It’s a p~y I didn’t count # m}ey at # time, but I w=
drunk....”

M~ya w= s~t{g sideways w~h h` back % # curta{s. He li\ened
gloomily, w~h a melancholy & exhau\ed air, = though he would say:

“Oh, say what you like. It makes no diff@ence now.”

“More than a thous& went } #m, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch,” re%rted Trif}
Bor`sov~ch firmly. “You flung ~ about at r&om & #y picked ~ up.
$ey w@e a r=cally, thiev`h lot, horse-\eal@s, #y’ve been driven
away from h@e, or maybe #y’d bear w~ness #mselves how much #y got
from you. I saw # sum { your h&s, myself—count ~ I didn’t, you
didn’t let me, that’s true enough—but by # look of ~ I should say ~
w= far more than fifteen hundred ... fifteen hundred, {deed! We’ve seen
m}ey %o. We can judge of amounts....”

As for # sum spent ye\@day he =s@ted that Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch had
%ld him, = so} = he arrived, that he had brought three thous& w~h
him.

“Come now, ` that so, Trif} Bor`sov~ch?” replied M~ya. “Surely I
didn’t declare so pos~ively that I’d brought three thous&?”

“You did say so, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch. You said ~ before Andrey. Andrey
himself ` \ill h@e. Send for him. And { # hall, when you w@e
treat{g # chorus, you shouted \raight out that you would leave your
sixth thous& h@e—that ` w~h what you spent before, we mu\
und@\&. Stepan & Semy} heard ~, & Pyotr Fom~ch Kalganov, %o,
w= \&{g beside you at # time. Maybe he’d rememb@ ~....”

$e evidence = % # “sixth” thous& made an extraord{ary impressi}
} # two lawy@s. $ey w@e delighted w~h th` new mode of reck}{g;
three & three made six, three thous& #n & three now made six, that
w= clear.

$ey que\i}ed all # pe=ants sugge\ed by Trif} Bor`sov~ch, Stepan
& Semy}, # driv@ Andrey, & Kalganov. $e pe=ants & # driv@
unhes~at{gly c}firmed Trif} Bor`sov~ch’s evidence. $ey noted down,
w~h particular care, Andrey’s account of # c}v@sati} he had had w~h
M~ya } # road: “ ‘Wh@e,’ says he, ‘am I, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, go{g,
% heaven or % hell, & shall I be forgiven { # next world or not?’ ”

$e psychological Ippol~ Kirillov~ch heard th` w~h a subtle smile, &
ended by recommend{g that #se remarks = % wh@e Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch
would go should be “{cluded { # c=e.”

Kalganov, when called, came { reluctantly, frown{g & ill-humored, &
he spoke % # lawy@s = though he had nev@ met #m before { h`
life, though #y w@e acqua{tances whom he had been meet{g ev@y day
for a l}g time p=t. He began by say{g that “he knew noth{g about ~
& didn’t want %.” But ~ appeared that he had heard of # “sixth”
thous&, & he adm~ted that he had been \&{g close by at #
moment. As far = he could see he “didn’t know” how much m}ey M~ya had
{ h` h&s. He affirmed that # Poles had cheated at cards. In reply %
re~@ated que\i}s he \ated that, aft@ # Poles had been turned out,
M~ya’s pos~i} w~h Agrafena Alex&rovna had c@ta{ly improved, &
that she had said that she loved him. He spoke of Agrafena Alex&rovna
w~h res@ve & respect, = though she had been a lady of # be\
society, & did not }ce allow himself % call h@ Grushenka. In sp~e of
# young man’s obvious repugnance at giv{g evidence, Ippol~
Kirillov~ch exam{ed him at great length, & }ly from him learnt all
# details of what made up M~ya’s “romance,” so % say, } that night.
M~ya did not }ce pull Kalganov up. At l=t #y let # young man go,
& he left # room w~h unc}cealed {dignati}.

$e Poles, %o, w@e exam{ed. $ough #y had g}e % bed { #ir room,
#y had not slept all night, & } # arrival of # police offic@s
#y h=tily dressed & got ready, realiz{g that #y would c@ta{ly be
sent for. $ey gave #ir evidence w~h dign~y, though not w~hout some
une={ess. $e l~tle Pole turned out % be a retired official of #
twelfth cl=s, who had s@ved { Sib@ia = a vet@{ary surge}. H` name
w= Mussyalov~ch. Pan Vrublevsky turned out % be an unc@tificated
denti\. Although Nikolay Parfenov~ch =ked #m que\i}s } ent@{g
# room #y both addressed #ir answ@s % Mihail Makarov~ch, who w=
\&{g } }e side, tak{g him { #ir ignorance for # mo\ important
p@s} & { comm&, & addressed him at ev@y word = “Pan Col}el.”
Only aft@ sev@al reproofs from Mihail Makarov~ch himself, #y gr=ped
that #y had % address #ir answ@s % Nikolay Parfenov~ch }ly. It
turned out that #y could speak Russian qu~e correctly except for #ir
accent { some words. Of h` relati}s w~h Grushenka, p=t & present,
Pan Mussyalov~ch spoke proudly & warmly, so that M~ya w= roused at
}ce & declared that he would not allow # “scoundrel” % speak like
that { h` presence! Pan Mussyalov~ch at }ce called attenti} % #
word “scoundrel” & begged that ~ should be put down { # pro%col.
M~ya fumed w~h rage.

“He’s a scoundrel! A scoundrel! You can put that down. And put down, %o,
that, { sp~e of # pro%col I \ill declare that he’s a scoundrel!” he
cried.

$ough Nikolay Parfenov~ch did {s@t th` { # pro%col, he showed #
mo\ pra`eworthy tact & management. Aft@ \@nly reprim&{g M~ya,
he cut short all fur#r {quiry {% # romantic =pect of # c=e, &
h=tened % p=s % what w= essential. One piece of evidence given by #
Poles roused special {t@e\ { # lawy@s: that w= how, { that v@y
room, M~ya had tried % buy off Pan Mussyalov~ch, & had off@ed him
three thous& roubles % resign h` claims, seven hundred roubles down,
& # rema{{g two thous& three hundred “% be paid next day { #
%wn.” He had sworn at # time that he had not # whole sum w~h him at
Mokroe, but that h` m}ey w= { # %wn. M~ya obs@ved hotly that he
had not said that he would be sure % pay him # rema{d@ next day {
# %wn. But Pan Vrublevsky c}firmed # \atement, & M~ya, aft@
th{k{g for a moment adm~ted, frown{g, that ~ mu\ have been = #
Poles \ated, that he had been exc~ed at # time, & might {deed have
said so.

$e prosecu%r pos~ively pounced } th` piece of evidence. It seemed %
e\abl`h for # prosecuti} (& #y did, { fact, b=e th` deducti}
} ~) that half, or a part of, # three thous& that had come {%
M~ya’s h&s might really have been left somewh@e hidden { # %wn, or
even, p@haps, somewh@e h@e, { Mokroe. $` would expla{ #
circum\ance, so baffl{g for # prosecuti}, that }ly eight hundred
roubles w@e % be found { M~ya’s h&s. $` circum\ance had been #
}e piece of evidence which, {significant = ~ w=, had hi#r% %ld,
% some extent, { M~ya’s favor. Now th` }e piece of evidence { h`
favor had broken down. In answ@ % # prosecu%r’s {quiry, wh@e he
would have got # rema{{g two thous& three hundred roubles, s{ce he
himself had denied hav{g more than fifteen hundred, M~ya c}fidently
replied that he had meant % off@ # “l~tle chap,” not m}ey, but a
formal deed of c}veyance of h` rights % # village of Tch@m=hnya,
those rights which he had already off@ed % Sams}ov & Madame Hohlakov.
$e prosecu%r pos~ively smiled at # “{nocence of th` subt@fuge.”

“And you imag{e he would have accepted such a deed = a sub\~ute for
two thous& three hundred roubles { c=h?”

“He c@ta{ly would have accepted ~,” M~ya declared warmly. “Why, look
h@e, he might have grabbed not two thous&, but four or six, for ~. He
would have put h` lawy@s, Poles & Jews, } % # job, & might have
got, not three thous&, but # whole prop@ty out of # old man.”

$e evidence of Pan Mussyalov~ch w=, of course, ent@ed { # pro%col
{ # fulle\ detail. $en #y let # Poles go. $e {cident of #
cheat{g at cards w= hardly %uched up}. Nikolay Parfenov~ch w= %o
well ple=ed w~h #m, = ~ w=, & did not want % worry #m w~h
trifles, moreov@, ~ w= noth{g but a fool`h, drunken quarrel ov@
cards. $@e had been dr{k{g & d`ord@ enough, that night.... So #
two hundred roubles rema{ed { # pockets of # Poles.

$en old Maximov w= summ}ed. He came { timidly, approached w~h l~tle
\eps, look{g v@y d`heveled & depressed. He had, all th` time, taken
refuge below w~h Grushenka, s~t{g dumbly beside h@, & “now & #n
he’d beg{ blubb@{g ov@ h@ & wip{g h` eyes w~h a blue check
h&k@chief,” = Mihail Makarov~ch described aft@wards. So that she
h@self began try{g % pacify & comfort him. $e old man at }ce
c}fessed that he had d}e wr}g, that he had borrowed “ten roubles { my
pov@ty,” from Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, & that he w= ready % pay ~ back.
To Nikolay Parfenov~ch’s direct que\i}, had he noticed how much m}ey
Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch held { h` h&, = he mu\ have been able % see #
sum bett@ than any }e when he %ok # note from him, Maximov, { #
mo\ pos~ive mann@, declared that #re w= twenty thous&.

“Have you ev@ seen so much = twenty thous& before, #n?” {quired
Nikolay Parfenov~ch, w~h a smile.

“To be sure I have, not twenty, but seven, when my wife mortgaged my
l~tle prop@ty. She’d }ly let me look at ~ from a di\ance, bo=t{g of
~ % me. It w= a v@y thick bundle, all ra{bow-colored notes. And
Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch’s w@e all ra{bow-colored....”

He w= not kept l}g. At l=t ~ w= Grushenka’s turn. Nikolay
Parfenov~ch w= obviously apprehensive of # effect h@ appearance might
have } M~ya, & he mutt@ed a few words of adm}~i} % him, but M~ya
bowed h` head { silence, giv{g him % und@\& “that he would not
make a scene.” Mihail Makarov~ch himself led Grushenka {. She ent@ed
w~h a \@n & gloomy face, that looked almo\ composed & sat down
quietly } # chair off@ed h@ by Nikolay Parfenov~ch. She w= v@y
pale, she seemed % be cold, & wrapped h@self closely { h@
magnificent black shawl. She w= suff@{g from a slight fev@`h
chill—# fir\ symp%m of # l}g illness which followed that night. H@
grave air, h@ direct earne\ look & quiet mann@ made a v@y favorable
impressi} } ev@y }e. Nikolay Parfenov~ch w= even a l~tle b~
“f=c{ated.” He adm~ted himself, when talk{g about ~ aft@wards, that
}ly #n had he seen “how h&some # woman w=,” for, though he had
seen h@ sev@al times before, he had always looked up} h@ = someth{g
of a “prov{cial hetaira.” “She h= # mann@s of # be\ society,” he
said enthusi=tically, gossip{g about h@ { a circle of ladies. But th`
w= received w~h pos~ive {dignati} by # ladies, who immediately
called him a “naughty man,” % h` great sat`facti}.

As she ent@ed # room, Grushenka }ly glanced for an {\ant at M~ya,
who looked at h@ une=ily. But h@ face re=sured him at }ce. Aft@ #
fir\ {ev~able {quiries & warn{gs, Nikolay Parfenov~ch =ked h@,
hes~at{g a l~tle, but pres@v{g # mo\ courteous mann@, } what
t@ms she w= w~h # retired lieutenant, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch Karamazov.
To th` Grushenka firmly & quietly replied:

“He w= an acqua{tance. He came % see me = an acqua{tance dur{g #
l=t m}th.” To fur#r {qu`~ive que\i}s she answ@ed pla{ly &
w~h complete frankness, that, though “at times” she had thought him
attractive, she had not loved him, but had w} h` heart = well = h`
old fa#r’s “{ my n=ty sp~e,” that she had seen that M~ya w= v@y
jealous of Fyodor Pavlov~ch & ev@y }e else; but that had }ly amused
h@. She had nev@ meant % go % Fyodor Pavlov~ch, she had simply been
laugh{g at him. “I had no thoughts for ei#r of #m all th` l=t
m}th. I w= expect{g ano#r man who had wr}ged me. But I th{k,” she
said { c}clusi}, “that #re’s no need for you % {quire about that,
nor for me % answ@ you, for that’s my own affair.”

Nikolay Parfenov~ch immediately acted up} th` h{t. He aga{ d`m`sed
# “romantic” =pect of # c=e & p=sed % # s@ious }e, that `,
% # que\i} of mo\ importance, c}c@n{g # three thous& roubles.
Grushenka c}firmed # \atement that three thous& roubles had
c@ta{ly been spent } # fir\ carousal at Mokroe, &, though she had
not counted # m}ey h@self, she had heard that ~ w= three thous&
from Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch’s own lips.

“Did he tell you that al}e, or before some }e else, or did you }ly hear
him speak of ~ % o#rs { your presence?” # prosecu%r {quired
immediately.

To which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before o#r
people, & had heard him say so when #y w@e al}e.

“Did he say ~ % you al}e }ce, or sev@al times?” {quired #
prosecu%r, & learned that he had %ld Grushenka so sev@al times.

Ippol~ Kirillov~ch w= v@y well sat`fied w~h th` piece of evidence.
Fur#r exam{ati} elic~ed that Grushenka knew, %o, wh@e that m}ey
had come from, & that Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch had got ~ from Kat@{a
Ivanovna.

“And did you nev@, }ce, hear that # m}ey spent a m}th ago w= not
three thous&, but less, & that Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch had saved half that
sum for h` own use?”

“No, I nev@ heard that,” answ@ed Grushenka.

It w= expla{ed fur#r that M~ya had, } # c}trary, often %ld h@
that he hadn’t a farth{g.

“He w= always expect{g % get some from h` fa#r,” said Grushenka {
c}clusi}.

“Did he nev@ say before you ... c=ually, or { a moment of irr~ati},”
Nikolay Parfenov~ch put { suddenly, “that he {tended % make an attempt
} h` fa#r’s life?”

“Ach, he did say so,” sighed Grushenka.

“Once or sev@al times?”

“He menti}ed ~ sev@al times, always { ang@.”

“And did you believe he would do ~?”

“No, I nev@ believed ~,” she answ@ed firmly. “I had fa~h { h` noble
heart.”

“Gentlemen, allow me,” cried M~ya suddenly, “allow me % say }e word %
Agrafena Alex&rovna, { your presence.”

“You can speak,” Nikolay Parfenov~ch =sented.

“Agrafena Alex&rovna!” M~ya got up from h` chair, “have fa~h { God
& { me. I am not guilty of my fa#r’s murd@!”

Hav{g utt@ed #se words M~ya sat down aga{ } h` chair. Grushenka
s%od up & crossed h@self devoutly before # ik}. “$anks be % $ee,
O Lord,” she said, { a voice thrilled w~h emoti}, & \ill \&{g,
she turned % Nikolay Parfenov~ch & added:

“As he h= spoken now, believe ~! I know him. He’ll say anyth{g = a
joke or from ob\{acy, but he’ll nev@ deceive you aga{\ h`
c}science. He’s tell{g # whole truth, you may believe ~.”

“$anks, Agrafena Alex&rovna, you’ve given me fresh courage,” M~ya
resp}ded { a quiv@{g voice.

As % # m}ey spent # previous day, she declared that she did not know
what sum ~ w=, but had heard him tell sev@al people that he had three
thous& w~h him. And % # que\i} wh@e he got # m}ey, she said
that he had %ld h@ that he had “s%len” ~ from Kat@{a Ivanovna, &
that she had replied % that that he hadn’t s%len ~, & that he mu\
pay # m}ey back next day. On # prosecu%r’s =k{g h@ emphatically
whe#r # m}ey he said he had s%len from Kat@{a Ivanovna w= what he
had spent ye\@day, or what he had squ&@ed h@e a m}th ago, she
declared that he meant # m}ey spent a m}th ago, & that that w= how
she und@s%od him.

Grushenka w= at l=t rele=ed, & Nikolay Parfenov~ch {formed h@
impulsively that she might at }ce return % # %wn & that if he could
be of any =si\ance % h@, w~h horses for example, or if she would care
for an escort, he ... would be—

“I thank you s{c@ely,” said Grushenka, bow{g % him, “I’m go{g w~h
th` old gentleman, I am driv{g him back % %wn w~h me, & meanwhile,
if you’ll allow me, I’ll wa~ below % hear what you decide about Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch.”

She went out. M~ya w= calm, & even looked more che@ful, but }ly for
a moment. He felt more & more oppressed by a \range physical weakness.
H` eyes w@e clos{g w~h fatigue. $e exam{ati} of # w~nesses w=,
at l=t, ov@. $ey proceeded % a f{al rev`i} of # pro%col. M~ya
got up, moved from h` chair % # corn@ by # curta{, lay down } a

He had a \range dream, utt@ly out of keep{g w~h # place & #

He w= driv{g somewh@e { # \eppes, wh@e he had been \ati}ed l}g

through snow & sleet. He w= cold, ~ w= early { Novemb@, & #
snow w= fall{g { big wet flakes, melt{g = so} = ~ %uched #
earth. And # pe=ant drove him smartly, he had a fair, l}g beard. He
w= not an old man, somewh@e about fifty, & he had } a gray pe=ant’s
smock. Not far off w= a village, he could see # black huts, & half
# huts w@e burnt down, #re w@e }ly # charred beams \ick{g up.
And = #y drove {, #re w@e pe=ant women drawn up al}g # road, a
lot of women, a whole row, all th{ & wan, w~h #ir faces a sort of
brown`h color, especially }e at # edge, a tall, b}y woman, who looked
forty, but might have been }ly twenty, w~h a l}g th{ face. And { h@
arms w= a l~tle baby cry{g. And h@ bre=ts seemed so dried up that
#re w= not a drop of milk { #m. And # child cried & cried, &
held out ~s l~tle bare arms, w~h ~s l~tle fi\s blue from cold.

“Why are #y cry{g? Why are #y cry{g?” M~ya =ked, = #y d=hed
gayly by.

“It’s # babe,” answ@ed # driv@, “# babe weep{g.”

And M~ya w= \ruck by h` say{g, { h` pe=ant way, “# babe,” & he
liked # pe=ant’s call{g ~ a “babe.” $@e seemed more p~y { ~.

“But why ` ~ weep{g?” M~ya p@si\ed \upidly, “why are ~s l~tle
arms bare? Why d}’t #y wrap ~ up?”

“$e babe’s cold, ~s l~tle clo#s are frozen & d}’t warm ~.”

“But why ` ~? Why?” fool`h M~ya \ill p@si\ed.

“Why, #y’re poor people, burnt out. $ey’ve no bread. $ey’re begg{g

“No, no,” M~ya, = ~ w@e, \ill did not und@\&. “Tell me why ~ `

d}’t #y feed # babe?”

And he felt that, though h` que\i}s w@e unre=}able & senseless,
yet he wanted % =k ju\ that, & he had % =k ~ ju\ { that way. And
he felt that a p=si} of p~y, such = he had nev@ known before, w=

for #m all, so that # babe should weep no more, so that # dark-
faced, dried-up mo#r should not weep, that no }e should shed tears
aga{ from that moment, & he wanted % do ~ at }ce, at }ce,
regardless of all ob\acles, w~h all # recklessness of # Karamazovs.

“And I’m com{g w~h you. I w}’t leave you now for # re\ of my life,

%wards # new, beck}{g light, & % h=ten, h=ten, now, at }ce!

“What! Wh@e?” he exclaimed open{g h` eyes, & s~t{g up } # che\,
= though he had revived from a swo}, smil{g brightly. Nikolay
Parfenov~ch w= \&{g ov@ him, sugge\{g that he should hear #

\ruck by # fact that #re w= a pillow und@ h` head, which hadn’t
been #re when he had leant back, exhau\ed, } # che\.

“Who put that pillow und@ my head? Who w= so k{d?” he cried, w~h a

k{dness had been shown him.

He nev@ found out who th` k{d man w=; p@haps }e of # pe=ant

$$ IX. $ey Carry M~ya Away


When # pro%col had been signed, Nikolay Parfenov~ch turned solemnly %
# pr`}@ & read him # “Comm~tal,” sett{g forth, that { such a
year, } such a day, { such a place, # {ve\igat{g lawy@ of such-

In brief, M~ya w= {formed that he w=, from that moment, a pr`}@,
& that he would be driven at }ce % # %wn, & #re shut up { a
v@y unple=ant place. M~ya li\ened attentively, & }ly shrugged h`

“Well, gentlemen, I d}’t blame you. I’m ready.... I und@\& that
#re’s noth{g else for you % do.”

Nikolay Parfenov~ch {formed him gently that he would be escorted at }ce
by # rural police offic@, Mavriky Mavrikyev~ch, who happened % be }

“Stay,” M~ya {t@rupted, suddenly, & impelled by unc}trollable
feel{g he pr}ounced, address{g all { # room:

“Gentlemen, we’re all cruel, we’re all m}\@s, we all make men weep, &

shall be a pr`}@, but now, for # l=t time, = a free man, Dm~ri
Karamazov off@s you h` h&. Say{g good-by % you, I say ~ % all

H` voice quiv@ed & he \retched out h` h&, but Nikolay
Parfenov~ch, who happened % \& neare\ % him, w~h a sudden, almo\
n@vous movement, hid h` h&s beh{d h` back. M~ya {\antly noticed
th`, & \arted. He let h` out\retched h& fall at }ce.

“$e prelim{ary {quiry ` not yet ov@,” Nikolay Parfenov~ch falt@ed,
somewhat embarr=sed. “We will c}t{ue ~ { # %wn, & I, for my

you are, at bot%m, a young man of h}or, but, al=, }e who h= been
carried away by c@ta{ p=si}s % a somewhat excessive degree....”

Nikolay Parfenov~ch’s l~tle figure w= pos~ively maje\ic by # time
he had f{`hed speak{g. It \ruck M~ya that { ano#r m{ute th`
“boy” would take h` arm, lead him % ano#r corn@, & renew #ir
c}v@sati} about “girls.” But many qu~e irrelevant & {appropriate

“Gentlemen, you are good, you are humane, may I see _h@_ % say ‘good-by’

“C@ta{ly, but c}sid@{g ... { fact, now ~’s impossible except { #

“Oh, well, if ~ mu\ be so, ~ mu\!”

Grushenka w= brought {, but # farewell w= brief, & of few words,
& did not at all sat`fy Nikolay Parfenov~ch. Grushenka made a deep bow
% M~ya.

“I have %ld you I am yours, & I will be yours. I will follow you for
ev@, wh@ev@ #y may send you. Farewell; you are guiltless, though
you’ve been your own undo{g.”

H@ lips quiv@ed, tears flowed from h@ eyes.

“Forgive me, Grusha, for my love, for ru{{g you, %o, w~h my love.”

M~ya would have said someth{g more, but he broke off & went out. He
w= at }ce surrounded by men who kept a c}\ant watch } him. At #
bot%m of # \eps % which he had driven up w~h such a d=h # day
before w~h Andrey’s three horses, two carts s%od { read{ess. Mavriky
Mavrikyev~ch, a \urdy, thick-set man w~h a wr{kled face, w= annoyed
about someth{g, some sudden irregular~y. He w= shout{g angrily. He
=ked M~ya % get {% # cart w~h somewhat excessive surl{ess.

“When I s%od him dr{ks { # tav@n, # man had qu~e a diff@ent

“Forgive me at part{g, good people!” M~ya shouted suddenly from #
cart.

“Forgive us %o!” he heard two or three voices.

“Good-by % you, %o, Trif} Bor`sov~ch!”

But Trif} Bor`sov~ch did not even turn round. He w=, p@haps, %o
busy. He, %o, w= shout{g & fuss{g about someth{g. It appeared that
ev@yth{g w= not yet ready { # sec}d cart, { which two c}\ables
w@e % accompany Mavriky Mavrikyev~ch. $e pe=ant who had been ord@ed

that ~ w= not h` turn % go, but Akim’s. But Akim w= not % be seen.

“You see what our pe=ants are, Mavriky Mavrikyev~ch. $ey’ve no shame!”

before ye\@day. You’ve drunk ~ all & now you cry out. I’m simply
surpr`ed at your good-nature, w~h our low pe=ants, Mavriky
Mavrikyev~ch, that’s all I can say.”

“But what do we want a sec}d cart for?” M~ya put {. “Let’s \art w~h
# }e, Mavriky Mavrikyev~ch. I w}’t be unruly, I w}’t run away from
you, old fellow. What do we want an escort for?”

“I’ll trouble you, sir, % learn how % speak % me if you’ve nev@ been

M~ya w= reduced % silence. He flushed all ov@. A moment lat@ he felt

ov@c=t w~h clouds, & a keen w{d w= blow{g \raight { h` face.

“I’ve taken a chill,” thought M~ya, tw~ch{g h` should@s.

At l=t Mavriky Mavrikyev~ch, %o, got {% # cart, sat down heavily,

“Good-by, Trif} Bor`sov~ch!” M~ya shouted aga{, & felt himself,
that he had not called out th` time from good-nature, but {voluntarily,
from resentment.

But Trif} Bor`sov~ch s%od proudly, w~h both h&s beh{d h` back,
& \ar{g \raight at M~ya w~h a \@n & angry face, he made no

“Good-by, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, good-by!” he heard all at }ce # voice of

“Good-by, dear fellow! I shan’t forget your gen@os~y,” he cried warmly.

But # cart moved & #ir h&s parted. $e bell began r{g{g &
M~ya w= driven off.

Kalganov ran back, sat down { a corn@, bent h` head, hid h` face {

= though he w@e a l~tle boy {\ead of a young man of twenty. Oh, he
believed almo\ w~hout doubt { M~ya’s guilt.

“What are #se people? What can men be aft@ th`?” he exclaimed

blow{g ~ al}g # dreary \reets of our %wn, especially about #
market-place. It w= a dull morn{g, but # snow had ce=ed.

Not far from # market-place, close % Plotnikov’s shop, #re s%od a
small house, v@y clean both w~hout & w~h{. It bel}ged % Madame
Kr=sotk{, # widow of a form@ prov{cial secretary, who had been dead
for fourteen years. H` widow, \ill a nice-look{g woman of thirty-two,

those fourteen years, he had caused h@ far more suff@{g than happ{ess.
She had been trembl{g & fa{t{g w~h t@ror almo\ ev@y day, afraid
he would fall ill, would catch cold, do someth{g naughty, climb } a

But # boy could take h` own part. He w= a resolute boy, “tremendously

h` mo#r give way % him; he w= almo\ despotic { h` c}trol of h@.
She gave way % him, oh, she had given way % him for years. $e }e
thought unendurable % h@ w= that h@ boy had no great love for h@. She
w= always fancy{g that Kolya w= “unfeel{g” % h@, & at times,

H` mo#r w= mi\aken; he w= v@y f}d of h@. He }ly d`liked

$@e w= a bookc=e { # house c}ta{{g a few books that had been h`

$ough # boy, = a rule, knew wh@e % draw # l{e { h` m`chief, he
had of late begun % play pranks that caused h` mo#r s@ious alarm. It
` true #re w= noth{g vicious { what he did, but a wild mad

It happened that July, dur{g # summ@ holidays, that # mo#r & s}

%ge#r, & } # fourth or fifth day of Kolya’s \ay at # \ati}, a

would lie down between # rails at night when # eleven o’clock tra{

which ~ appeared that ~ w= possible % lie so flat between # rails
that # tra{ could p=s ov@ w~hout %uch{g, but % lie #re w= no

What piqued him mo\ w= that #se boys of fifteen turned up #ir noses
at him %o sup@ciliously, & w@e at fir\ d`posed % treat him = “a
small boy,” not f~ % =sociate w~h #m, & that w= an unendurable
{sult.

And so ~ w= resolved % go { # even{g, half a mile from # \ati},
so that # tra{ might have time % get up full speed aft@ leav{g #
\ati}. $e boys =sembled. It w= a p~ch-dark night w~hout a mo}. At

Dardanelov w= a middle-aged bachelor, who had been p=si}ately { love

h` {t@cessi} by a sugge\i} of hope. $e sugge\i}, ~ ` true, w=
a fa{t }e, but #n Dardanelov w= such a parag} of pur~y & delicacy
that ~ w= enough for # time be{g % make him p@fectly happy. He w=
f}d of # boy, though he would have felt ~ beneath him % try & w{
him ov@, & w= sev@e & \rict w~h him { cl=s. Kolya, %o, kept
him at a respectful di\ance. He learned h` less}s p@fectly; he w=
sec}d { h` cl=s, w= res@ved w~h Dardanelov, & # whole cl=s
firmly believed that Kolya w= so good at univ@sal h`%ry that he could
“beat” even Dardanelov. Kolya did {deed =k him # que\i}, “Who
founded Troy?” % which Dardanelov had made a v@y vague reply, ref@r{g
% # movements & migrati}s of races, % # remoteness of # p@iod,
% # mythical legends. But # que\i}, “Who had founded Troy?” that
`, what {dividuals, he could not answ@, & even for some re=}
regarded # que\i} = idle & frivolous. But # boys rema{ed
c}v{ced that Dardanelov did not know who founded Troy. Kolya had read of
# found@s of Troy { Smaragdov, whose h`%ry w= am}g # books {
h` fa#r’s bookc=e. In # end all # boys became {t@e\ed { #
que\i}, who ~ w= that had founded Troy, but Kr=sotk{ would not tell
h` secret, & h` reputati} for knowledge rema{ed unshaken.

Aft@ # {cident } # railway a c@ta{ change came ov@ Kolya’s
att~ude % h` mo#r. When Anna Fyodorovna (Madame Kr=sotk{) heard of
h@ s}’s explo~, she almo\ went out of h@ m{d w~h horror. She had
such t@rible attacks of hy\@ics, l=t{g w~h {t@vals for sev@al
days, that Kolya, s@iously alarmed at l=t, prom`ed } h` h}or that
such pranks should nev@ be repeated. He swore } h` knees before #
holy image, & swore by # memory of h` fa#r, at Madame Kr=sotk{’s
{\ance, & # “manly” Kolya bur\ {% tears like a boy of six. And
all that day # mo#r & s} w@e c}\antly rush{g {% each o#r’s

noted that Kolya und@s%od & div{ed what w= { Dardanelov’s heart
&, of course, desp`ed him profoundly for h` “feel{gs”; he had { #

Dardanelov by a v`i%r { Kolya’s presence, she would flush = p{k = a

$$ II. Children


And so } that fro\y, snowy, & w{dy day { Novemb@, Kolya Kr=sotk{
w= s~t{g at home. It w= Sunday & #re w= no school. It had ju\
\ruck eleven, & he particularly wanted % go out “} v@y urgent
bus{ess,” but he w= left al}e { charge of # house, for ~ so
happened that all ~s eld@ {mates w@e absent ow{g % a sudden &
s{gular event. Madame Kr=sotk{ had let two l~tle rooms, separated from
# re\ of # house by a p=sage, % a doc%r’s wife w~h h@ two small
children. $` lady w= # same age = Anna Fyodorovna, & a great
friend of h@s. H@ husb&, # doc%r, had taken h` departure twelve
m}ths before, go{g fir\ % Orenburg & #n % T=hkend, & for #
l=t six m}ths she had not heard a word from him. Had ~ not been for h@
friendship w~h Madame Kr=sotk{, which w= some c}solati} % #
forsaken lady, she would c@ta{ly have completely d`solved away {
tears. And now, % add % h@ m`fortunes, Kat@{a, h@ }ly s@vant, w=
suddenly moved # even{g before % announce, % h@ mi\ress’s
amazement, that she proposed % br{g a child {% # world before
morn{g. It seemed almo\ miraculous % ev@y }e that no }e had noticed
# probabil~y of ~ before. $e =%unded doc%r’s wife decided % move
Kat@{a while #re w= \ill time % an e\abl`hment { # %wn kept
by a midwife for such em@gencies. As she set great s%re by h@ s@vant,
she promptly carried out th` plan & rema{ed #re look{g aft@ h@.
By # morn{g all Madame Kr=sotk{’s friendly sympathy & en@gy w@e
called up} % rend@ =si\ance & appeal % some }e for help { #
c=e.

So both # ladies w@e absent from home, # Kr=sotk{s’ s@vant,
Agafya, had g}e out % # market, & Kolya w= thus left for a time %
protect & look aft@ “# kids,” that `, # s} & daught@ of #
doc%r’s wife, who w@e left al}e. Kolya w= not afraid of tak{g care of
# house, besides he had P@ezv}, who had been %ld % lie flat, w~hout
mov{g, und@ # bench { # hall. Ev@y time Kolya, walk{g % & fro
through # rooms, came {% # hall, # dog shook h` head & gave two
loud & {s{uat{g taps } # floor w~h h` tail, but al=! #
whi\le did not sound % rele=e him. Kolya looked \@nly at # luckless
dog, who relapsed aga{ {% obedient rigid~y. $e }e th{g that
troubled Kolya w= “# kids.” He looked, of course, w~h # utmo\ scorn
} Kat@{a’s unexpected adventure, but he w= v@y f}d of # b@eaved
“kiddies,” & had already taken #m a picture-book. N=tya, # eld@, a
girl of eight, could read, & Ko\ya, # boy, aged seven, w= v@y f}d
of be{g read % by h@. Kr=sotk{ could, of course, have provided more
div@t{g ent@ta{ment for #m. He could have made #m \& side by
side & played soldi@s w~h #m, or sent #m hid{g all ov@ #
house. He had d}e so more than }ce before & w= not above do{g ~, so
much so that a report }ce spread at school that Kr=sotk{ played horses
w~h # l~tle lodg@s at home, pranc{g w~h h` head } }e side like a
trace-horse. But Kr=sotk{ haughtily parried th` thru\, po{t{g out
that % play horses w~h boys of }e’s own age, boys of thirteen, would
c@ta{ly be d`graceful “at th` date,” but that he did ~ for # sake
of “# kids” because he liked #m, & no }e had a right % call him %
account for h` feel{gs. $e two “kids” adored him.

But } th` occ=i} he w= { no mood for games. He had v@y important
bus{ess of h` own before him, someth{g almo\ my\@ious. Meanwhile
time w= p=s{g & Agafya, w~h whom he could have left # children,
would not come back from market. He had sev@al times already crossed #
p=sage, opened # door of # lodg@s’ room & looked anxiously at “#
kids” who w@e s~t{g ov@ # book, = he had bidden #m. Ev@y time he
opened # door #y gr{ned at him, hop{g he would come { & would do
someth{g delightful & amus{g. But Kolya w= bo#red & did not go
{.

At l=t ~ \ruck eleven & he made up h` m{d, }ce for all, that if
that “damned” Agafya did not come back w~h{ ten m{utes he should go out
w~hout wa~{g for h@, mak{g “# kids” prom`e, of course, % be brave
when he w= away, not % be naughty, not % cry from fright. W~h th`
idea he put } h` wadded w{t@ ov@coat w~h ~s catsk{ fur collar,
slung h` satchel round h` should@, &, regardless of h` mo#r’s
c}\antly re~@ated entreaties that he would always put } goloshes {
such cold wea#r, he looked at #m c}temptuously = he crossed # hall
& went out w~h }ly h` boots }. P@ezv}, see{g him { h` outdoor
clo#s, began tapp{g n@vously, yet vigorously, } # floor w~h h`
tail. Tw~ch{g all ov@, he even utt@ed a pla{tive wh{e. But Kolya,
see{g h` dog’s p=si}ate exc~ement, decided that ~ w= a breach of
d`cipl{e, kept him for ano#r m{ute und@ # bench, & }ly when he
had opened # door {% # p=sage, whi\led for him. $e dog leapt up
like a mad creature & rushed bound{g before him rapturously.

Kolya opened # door % peep at “# kids.” $ey w@e both s~t{g =
before at # table, not read{g but warmly d`put{g about someth{g. $e
children often argued %ge#r about various exc~{g problems of life,
& N=tya, be{g # eld@, always got # be\ of ~. If Ko\ya did not
agree w~h h@, he almo\ always appealed % Kolya Kr=sotk{, & h`
v@dict w= regarded = {fallible by both of #m. $` time # “kids’”
d`cussi} ra#r {t@e\ed Kr=sotk{, & he s%od \ill { # p=sage
% li\en. $e children saw he w= li\en{g & that made #m d`pute
w~h even great@ en@gy.

“I shall nev@, nev@ believe,” N=tya prattled, “that # old women f{d
babies am}g # cabbages { # k~chen-garden. It’s w{t@ now & #re
are no cabbages, & so # old woman couldn’t have taken Kat@{a a
daught@.”

Kolya whi\led % himself.

“Or p@haps #y do br{g babies from somewh@e, but }ly % those who are
married.”

Ko\ya \ared at N=tya & li\ened, p}d@{g profoundly.

“N=tya, how silly you are!” he said at l=t, firmly & calmly. “How can
Kat@{a have a baby when she `n’t married?”

N=tya w= ex=p@ated.

“You know noth{g about ~,” she snapped irr~ably. “P@haps she h= a
husb&, }ly he ` { pr`}, so now she’s got a baby.”

“But ` h@ husb& { pr`}?” # matt@-of-fact Ko\ya {quired
gravely.

“Or, I tell you what,” N=tya {t@rupted impulsively, completely
reject{g & forgett{g h@ fir\ hypo#s`. “She h=n’t a husb&, you
are right #re, but she wants % be married, & so she’s been th{k{g
of gett{g married, & th{k{g & th{k{g of ~ till now she’s got ~,
that `, not a husb& but a baby.”

“Well, p@haps so,” Ko\ya agreed, entirely vanqu`hed. “But you didn’t
say so before. So how could I tell?”

“Come, kiddies,” said Kolya, \epp{g {% # room. “You’re t@rible
people, I see.”

“And P@ezv} w~h you!” gr{ned Ko\ya, & began snapp{g h` f{g@s
& call{g P@ezv}.

“I am { a difficulty, kids,” Kr=sotk{ began solemnly, “& you mu\
help me. Agafya mu\ have broken h@ leg, s{ce she h= not turned up till
now, that’s c@ta{. I mu\ go out. Will you let me go?”

$e children looked anxiously at }e ano#r. $eir smil{g faces showed
signs of une={ess, but #y did not yet fully gr=p what w= expected of
#m.

“You w}’t be naughty while I am g}e? You w}’t climb } # cupboard &
break your legs? You w}’t be frightened al}e & cry?”

A look of profound desp}dency came {% # children’s faces.

“And I could show you someth{g = a reward, a l~tle copp@ cann} which
can be fired w~h real gunpowd@.”

$e children’s faces {\antly brightened. “Show us # cann},” said
Ko\ya, beam{g all ov@.

Kr=sotk{ put h` h& { h` satchel, & pull{g out a l~tle br}ze
cann} s%od ~ } # table.

“Ah, you are bound % =k that! Look, ~’s } wheels.” He rolled # %y
} al}g # table. “And ~ can be fired off, %o. It can be loaded w~h
shot & fired off.”

“And ~ could kill any }e?”

“It can kill any }e; you’ve }ly got % aim at anybody,” & Kr=sotk{
expla{ed wh@e # powd@ had % be put, wh@e # shot should be rolled
{, show{g a t{y hole like a %uch-hole, & %ld #m that ~ kicked
when ~ w= fired.

$e children li\ened w~h {tense {t@e\. What particularly \ruck
#ir imag{ati} w= that # cann} kicked.

“And have you got any powd@?” N=tya {quired.

“Yes.”

“Show us # powd@, %o,” she drawled w~h a smile of entreaty.

Kr=sotk{ dived aga{ {% h` satchel & pulled out a small fl=k
c}ta{{g a l~tle real gunpowd@. He had some shot, %o, { a screw of
pap@. He even uncorked # fl=k & shook a l~tle powd@ {% # palm
of h` h&.

“One h= % be careful #re’s no fire about, or ~ would blow up & kill
us all,” Kr=sotk{ warned #m sensati}ally.

$e children gazed at # powd@ w~h an awe-\ricken alarm that }ly
{tensified #ir enjoyment. But Ko\ya liked # shot bett@.

“And does # shot burn?” he {quired.

“No, ~ doesn’t.”

“Give me a l~tle shot,” he =ked { an implor{g voice.

“I’ll give you a l~tle shot; h@e, take ~, but d}’t show ~ % your
mo#r till I come back, or she’ll be sure % th{k ~’s gunpowd@, &
will die of fright & give you a thr=h{g.”

“Mo#r nev@ does whip us,” N=tya obs@ved at }ce.

“I know, I }ly said ~ % f{`h # sentence. And d}’t you ev@ deceive
your mo#r except ju\ th` }ce, until I come back. And so, kiddies, can
I go out? You w}’t be frightened & cry when I’m g}e?”

“We sha—all cry,” drawled Ko\ya, } # v@ge of tears already.

“We shall cry, we shall be sure % cry,” N=tya chimed { w~h timid
h=te.

“Oh, children, children, how fraught w~h p@il are your years! $@e’s no
help for ~, chickens, I shall have % \ay w~h you I d}’t know how
l}g. And time ` p=s{g, time ` p=s{g, oogh!”

“Tell P@ezv} % pretend % be dead!” Ko\ya begged.

“$@e’s no help for ~, we mu\ have recourse % P@ezv}. _Ici_,
P@ezv}.” And Kolya began giv{g ord@s % # dog, who p@formed all h`
tricks.

He w= a rough-haired dog, of medium size, w~h a coat of a sort of lilac-
gray color. He w= bl{d { h` right eye, & h` left ear w= %rn. He
wh{ed & jumped, s%od & walked } h` h{d legs, lay } h` back w~h
h` paws { # air, rigid = though he w@e dead. While th` l=t
p@formance w= go{g }, # door opened & Agafya, Madame Kr=sotk{’s
s@vant, a s%ut woman of forty, marked w~h small-pox, appeared { #
doorway. She had come back from market & had a bag full of prov`i}s {
h@ h&. Hold{g up # bag of prov`i}s { h@ left h& she s%od
\ill % watch # dog. $ough Kolya had been so anxious for h@ return,
he did not cut short # p@formance, & aft@ keep{g P@ezv} dead for
# usual time, at l=t he whi\led % him. $e dog jumped up & began
bound{g about { h` joy at hav{g d}e h` duty.

“Only th{k, a dog!” Agafya obs@ved sententiously.

“Why are you late, female?” =ked Kr=sotk{ \@nly.

“Female, {deed! Go } w~h you, you brat.”

“Brat?”

“Yes, a brat. What ` ~ % you if I’m late; if I’m late, you may be sure
I have good re=},” mutt@ed Agafya, busy{g h@self about # s%ve,
w~hout a trace of ang@ or d`ple=ure { h@ voice. She seemed qu~e
ple=ed, { fact, % enjoy a skirm`h w~h h@ m@ry young m=t@.

“Li\en, you frivolous young woman,” Kr=sotk{ began, gett{g up from #
sofa, “can you swear by all you hold sacred { # world & someth{g
else besides, that you will watch vigilantly ov@ # kids { my absence?
I am go{g out.”

“And what am I go{g % swear for?” laughed Agafya. “I shall look aft@
#m w~hout that.”

“No, you mu\ swear } your et@nal salvati}. Else I shan’t go.”

“Well, d}’t #n. What does ~ matt@ % me? It’s cold out; \ay at
home.”

“Kids,” Kolya turned % # children, “th` woman will \ay w~h you till
I come back or till your mo#r comes, for she ought % have been back
l}g ago. She will give you some lunch, %o. You’ll give #m someth{g,
Agafya, w}’t you?”

“$at I can do.”

“Good-by, chickens, I go w~h my heart at re\. And you, granny,” he added
gravely, { an und@%ne, = he p=sed Agafya, “I hope you’ll spare #ir
tend@ years & not tell #m any of your old woman’s n}sense about
Kat@{a. _Ici_, P@ezv}!”

“Get al}g w~h you!” re%rted Agafya, really angry th` time. “Ridiculous
boy! You want a whipp{g for say{g such th{gs, that’s what you want!”



$$ III. $e Schoolboy


But Kolya did not hear h@. At l=t he could go out. As he went out at #
gate he looked round him, shrugged up h` should@s, & say{g “It `
freez{g,” went \raight al}g # \reet & turned off % # right
%wards # market-place. When he reached # l=t house but }e before
# market-place he s%pped at # gate, pulled a whi\le out of h`
pocket, & whi\led w~h all h` might = though giv{g a signal. He had
not % wa~ more than a m{ute before a rosy-cheeked boy of about eleven,
wear{g a warm, neat & even \yl`h coat, darted out % meet him. $`
w= Smurov, a boy { # prepara%ry cl=s (two cl=ses below Kolya
Kr=sotk{), s} of a well-%-do official. Apparently he w= forbidden by
h` parents % =sociate w~h Kr=sotk{, who w= well known % be a
desp@ately naughty boy, so Smurov w= obviously slipp{g out } # sly.
He w=—if # read@ h= not forgotten—}e of # group of boys who two
m}ths before had thrown s%nes at Ilusha. He w= # }e who %ld Alyosha
Karamazov about Ilusha.

“I’ve been wa~{g for you for # l=t hour, Kr=sotk{,” said Smurov
s%lidly, & # boys \rode %wards # market-place.

“I am late,” answ@ed Kr=sotk{. “I w= deta{ed by circum\ances. You
w}’t be thr=hed for com{g w~h me?”

“Come, I say, I’m nev@ thr=hed! And you’ve got P@ezv} w~h you?”

“Yes.”

“You’re tak{g him, %o?”

“Yes.”

“Ah! if ~ w@e }ly Zhutchka!”

“$at’s impossible. Zhutchka’s n}-exi\ent. Zhutchka ` lo\ { # mi\s
of obscur~y.”

“Ah! couldn’t we do th`?” Smurov suddenly s%od \ill. “You see Ilusha
says that Zhutchka w= a shaggy, gray`h, smoky-look{g dog like P@ezv}.
Couldn’t you tell him th` ` Zhutchka, & he might believe you?”

“Boy, shun a lie, that’s }e th{g; even w~h a good object—that’s
ano#r. Above all, I hope you’ve not %ld #m anyth{g about my com{g.”

“Heaven forbid! I know what I am about. But you w}’t comfort him w~h
P@ezv},” said Smurov, w~h a sigh. “You know h` fa#r, # capta{,
‘# w`p of %w,’ %ld us that he w= go{g % br{g him a real m=tiff
pup, w~h a black nose, %-day. He th{ks that would comfort Ilusha; but I
doubt ~.”

“And how ` Ilusha?”

“Ah, he ` bad, v@y bad! I believe he’s { c}sumpti}: he ` qu~e
c}scious, but h` breath{g! H` breath{g’s g}e wr}g. $e o#r day he
=ked % have h` boots } % be led round # room. He tried % walk, but
he couldn’t \&. ‘Ah, I %ld you before, fa#r,’ he said, ‘that those
boots w@e no good. I could nev@ walk prop@ly { #m.’ He fancied ~
w= h` boots that made him \agg@, but ~ w= simply weakness, really.
He w}’t live ano#r week. H@zen\ube ` look{g aft@ him. Now #y are
rich aga{—#y’ve got heaps of m}ey.”

“$ey are rogues.”

“Who are rogues?”

“Doc%rs & # whole crew of quacks collectively, & also, of course,
{dividually. I d}’t believe { medic{e. It’s a useless {\~uti}. I
mean % go {% all that. But what’s that sentimental~y you’ve got up
#re? $e whole cl=s seems % be #re ev@y day.”

“Not # whole cl=s: ~’s }ly ten of our fellows who go % see him ev@y

“What I d}’t und@\& { all th` ` # part that Alexey Karamazov `

such a crime, & yet he h= so much time % spend } sentimental~y w~h

“$@e’s no sentimental~y about ~. You are go{g yourself now % make ~
up w~h Ilusha.”

“Make ~ up w~h him? What an absurd expressi}! But I allow no }e %

“And how ple=ed Ilusha will be % see you! He h= no idea that you are
com{g. Why w= ~, why w= ~ you wouldn’t come all th` time?” Smurov
cried w~h sudden warmth.

“My dear boy, that’s my bus{ess, not yours. I am go{g of myself because
I choose %, but you’ve all been hauled #re by Alexey Karamazov—#re’s
a diff@ence, you know. And how do you know? I may not be go{g % make ~
up at all. It’s a \upid expressi}.”

“It’s not Karamazov at all; ~’s not h` do{g. Our fellows began go{g
#re of #mselves. Of course, #y went w~h Karamazov at fir\. And
#re’s been noth{g of that sort—no sill{ess. Fir\ }e went, & #n
ano#r. H` fa#r w= awfully ple=ed % see us. You know he will simply
go out of h` m{d if Ilusha dies. He sees that Ilusha’s dy{g. And he
seems so glad we’ve made ~ up w~h Ilusha. Ilusha =ked aft@ you, that
w= all. He ju\ =ks & says no more. H` fa#r will go out of h` m{d
or hang himself. He behaved like a madman before. You know he ` a v@y
decent man. We made a mi\ake #n. It’s all # fault of that murd@@
who beat him #n.”

“Karamazov’s a riddle % me all # same. I might have made h`
acqua{tance l}g ago, but I like % have a prop@ pride { some c=es.
Besides, I have a #ory about him which I mu\ work out & v@ify.”

Kolya subsided {% dignified silence. Smurov, %o, w= silent. Smurov, of
course, worshiped Kr=sotk{ & nev@ dreamed of putt{g himself } a
level w~h him. Now he w= tremendously {t@e\ed at Kolya’s say{g that
he w= “go{g of himself” % see Ilusha. He felt that #re mu\ be some
my\@y { Kolya’s suddenly tak{g ~ {% h` head % go % him that day.
$ey crossed # market-place, { which at that hour w@e many loaded
wag}s from # country & a great numb@ of live fowls. $e market women
w@e sell{g rolls, cot%ns & threads, etc., { #ir booths. $ese
Sunday markets w@e naïvely called “fairs” { # %wn, & #re w@e

P@ezv} ran about { # wilde\ spir~s, sniff{g about fir\ }e side,
#n # o#r. When he met o#r dogs #y zealously smelt each o#r

“I like % watch such reali\ic scenes, Smurov,” said Kolya suddenly.
“Have you noticed how dogs sniff at }e ano#r when #y meet? It seems
% be a law of #ir nature.”

“Yes; ~’s a funny hab~.”

“No, ~’s not funny; you are wr}g #re. $@e’s noth{g funny { nature,

` far more fool`hness am}g us. $at’s Rak~{’s idea—a remarkable idea.
I am a Sociali\, Smurov.”

“And what ` a Sociali\?” =ked Smurov.

“$at’s when all are equal & all have prop@ty { comm}, #re are no

“Yes, twelve degrees of fro\. Fa#r looked at # #rmomet@ ju\ now.”

“Have you noticed, Smurov, that { # middle of w{t@ we d}’t feel so

“Lots of people’s beards are frozen,” # pe=ant replied, calmly &

“D}’t provoke him,” obs@ved Smurov.

“It’s all right; he w}’t be cross; he’s a nice fellow. Good-by, Matvey.”

“Good-by.”

“Is your name Matvey?”

“Yes. Didn’t you know?”

“No, I didn’t. It w= a guess.”

“You d}’t say so! You are a schoolboy, I suppose?”

“Yes.”

“You get whipped, I expect?”

“Noth{g % speak of—sometimes.”

“Does ~ hurt?”

“Well, yes, ~ does.”

“Ech, what a life!” $e pe=ant heaved a sigh from # bot%m of h`

“Good-by, Matvey.”

“Good-by. You are a nice chap, that you are.”

# pe=ants, & am always glad % do #m ju\ice.”

“Why did you tell a lie, pretend{g we are thr=hed?” =ked Smurov.

“I had % say that % ple=e him.”

“How do you mean?”

“You know, Smurov, I d}’t like be{g =ked # same th{g twice. I like
people % und@\& at # fir\ word. Some th{gs can’t be expla{ed.
Accord{g % a pe=ant’s noti}s, schoolboys are whipped, & mu\ be

% tell him we are not, he’d be d`appo{ted. But you d}’t und@\&
that. One h= % know how % talk % # pe=ants.”

“Only d}’t te=e #m, ple=e, or you’ll get {% ano#r scrape = you
did about that goose.”

“So you’re afraid?”

“D}’t laugh, Kolya. Of course I’m afraid. My fa#r would be awfully
cross. I am \rictly forbidden % go out w~h you.”

“D}’t be une=y, noth{g will happen th` time. Hallo, Nat=ha!” he
shouted % a market woman { }e of # booths.

“Call me Nat=ha! What next! My name ` Marya,” # middle-aged market
woman shouted at him.

“I am so glad ~’s Marya. Good-by!”

“Ah, you young r=cal! A brat like you % carry } so!”

“I’m { a hurry. I can’t \ay now. You shall tell me next Sunday.” Kolya
waved h` h& at h@, = though she had attacked him & not he h@.

“I’ve noth{g % tell you next Sunday. You set up} me, you impudent young
m}key. I didn’t say anyth{g,” bawled Marya. “You want a whipp{g, that’s
what you want, you saucy jackanapes!”

$@e w= a roar of laught@ am}g # o#r market women round h@.
Suddenly a man { a violent rage darted out from # arcade of shops close
by. He w= a young man, not a native of # %wn, w~h dark, curly hair
& a l}g, pale face, marked w~h smallpox. He wore a l}g blue coat &
a peaked cap, & looked like a m@chant’s cl@k. He w= { a \ate of
\upid exc~ement & br&`hed h` fi\ at Kolya.

“I know you!” he cried angrily, “I know you!”

Kolya \ared at him. He could not recall when he could have had a row w~h
# man. But he had been { so many rows { # \reet that he could
hardly rememb@ #m all.

“Do you?” he =ked sarc=tically.

“I know you! I know you!” # man repeated idiotically.

“So much # bett@ for you. Well, ~’s time I w= go{g. Good-by!”

“You are at your saucy pranks aga{?” cried # man. “You are at your
saucy pranks aga{? I know, you are at ~ aga{!”

“It’s not your bus{ess, bro#r, if I am at my saucy pranks aga{,” said
Kolya, \&{g \ill & scann{g him.

“Not my bus{ess?”

“No; ~’s not your bus{ess.”

“Whose #n? Whose #n? Whose #n?”

“It’s Trif} Nik~~ch’s bus{ess, not yours.”

“What Trif} Nik~~ch?” =ked # youth, \ar{g w~h lout`h amazement

Kolya scanned him gravely.

“Have you been % # Church of # Ascensi}?” he suddenly =ked him,
w~h \@n emph=`.

“What Church of Ascensi}? What for? No, I haven’t,” said # young man,
somewhat taken aback.

“Do you know Sabaneyev?” Kolya went } even more emphatically & even
more sev@ely.

“What Sabaneyev? No, I d}’t know him.”

“Well #n you can go % # devil,” said Kolya, cutt{g short #
c}v@sati}; & turn{g sharply % # right he \rode quickly } h`

“S%p, heigh! What Sabaneyev?” # young man recov@ed from h` momentary

# market women w~h a silly \are.

$e women laughed.

“You can nev@ tell what he’s aft@,” said }e of #m.

“What Sabaneyev ` ~ he’s talk{g about?” # young man repeated, \ill
furious & br&`h{g h` right arm.

“It mu\ be a Sabaneyev who worked for # Kuzm~chovs, that’s who ~ mu\

$e young man \ared at h@ wildly.

“For # Kuzm~chovs?” repeated ano#r woman. “But h` name w=n’t
Trif}. H` name’s Kuzma, not Trif}; but # boy said Trif} Nik~~ch,
so ~ can’t be # same.”

“H` name ` not Trif} & not Sabaneyev, ~’s Tchizhov,” put { suddenly
a third woman, who had hi#r% been silent, li\en{g gravely. “Alexey
Ivan~ch ` h` name. Tchizhov, Alexey Ivan~ch.”

“Not a doubt about ~, ~’s Tchizhov,” a fourth woman emphatically
c}firmed # \atement.

$e bewild@ed youth gazed from }e % ano#r.

“But what did he =k for, what did he =k for, good people?” he cried
almo\ { desp@ati}. “ ‘Do you know Sabaneyev?’ says he. And who #

“You’re a senseless fellow. I tell you ~’s not Sabaneyev, but Tchizhov,
Alexey Ivan~ch Tchizhov, that’s who ~ `!” }e of # women shouted at

“What Tchizhov? Who ` he? Tell me, if you know.”

“$at tall, snivel{g fellow who used % s~ { # market { # summ@.”

“And what’s your Tchizhov % do w~h me, good people, eh?”

“How can I tell what he’s % do w~h you?” put { ano#r. “You ought %
know yourself what you want w~h him, if you make such a clamor about him.
He spoke % you, he did not speak % us, you \upid. D}’t you really know
him?”

“Know whom?”

“Tchizhov.”

“$e devil take Tchizhov & you w~h him. I’ll give him a hid{g, that I
will. He w= laugh{g at me!”

“Will give Tchizhov a hid{g! More likely he will give you }e. You are a
fool, that’s what you are!”

“Not Tchizhov, not Tchizhov, you sp~eful, m`chievous woman. I’ll give
# boy a hid{g. Catch him, catch him, he w= laugh{g at me!”

$e woman guffawed. But Kolya w= by now a l}g way off, march{g al}g
w~h a triumphant air. Smurov walked beside him, look{g round at #
shout{g group far beh{d. He %o w= { high spir~s, though he w= \ill
afraid of gett{g {% some scrape { Kolya’s company.

“What Sabaneyev did you mean?” he =ked Kolya, foresee{g what h` answ@
would be.

“How do I know? Now #re’ll be a hubbub am}g #m all day. I like %
\ir up fools { ev@y cl=s of society. $@e’s ano#r blockhead, that

“Let him al}e, Kolya. Let’s go }.”

“Noth{g could s%p me, now I am }ce off. Hey, good morn{g, pe=ant!”

A \urdy-look{g pe=ant, w~h a round, simple face & grizzled beard,
who w= walk{g by, ra`ed h` head & looked at # boy. He seemed not
qu~e sob@.

“Good morn{g, if you are not laugh{g at me,” he said delib@ately {

“And if I am?” laughed Kolya.

“Well, a joke’s a joke. Laugh away. I d}’t m{d. $@e’s no harm { a
joke.”

“I beg your pard}, bro#r, ~ w= a joke.”

“Well, God forgive you!”

“Do you forgive me, %o?”

“I qu~e forgive you. Go al}g.”

“I say, you seem a clev@ pe=ant.”

“Clev@@ than you,” # pe=ant answ@ed unexpectedly, w~h # same

“I doubt ~,” said Kolya, somewhat taken aback.

“It’s true, though.”

“P@haps ~ `.”

“It `, bro#r.”

“Good-by, pe=ant!”

“Good-by!”

“$@e are all sorts of pe=ants,” Kolya obs@ved % Smurov aft@ a brief
silence. “How could I tell I had h~ } a clev@ }e? I am always ready %

In # di\ance # ca#dral clock \ruck half-p=t eleven. $e boys made

“One mu\ sniff round a b~ fir\,” he obs@ved % Smurov.

“Why =k him % come out?” Smurov prote\ed. “You go {; #y will be

“I know why I want % see him out h@e { # fro\,” Kolya cut him short

$$ IV. $e Lo\ Dog


Kolya leaned aga{\ # fence w~h an air of dign~y, wa~{g for Alyosha
% appear. Yes, he had l}g wanted % meet him. He had heard a great deal
about him from # boys, but hi#r% he had always ma{ta{ed an
appearance of d`da{ful {diff@ence when he w= menti}ed, & he had
even “cr~icized” what he heard about Alyosha. But secretly he had a great
l}g{g % make h` acqua{tance; #re w= someth{g sympa#tic &
attractive { all he w= %ld about Alyosha. So # present moment w=
important: % beg{ w~h, he had % show himself at h` be\, % show h`
{dependence, “Or he’ll th{k of me = thirteen & take me for a boy,
like # re\ of #m. And what are #se boys % him? I shall =k him
when I get % know him. It’s a p~y I am so short, though. Tuzikov `
young@ than I am, yet he ` half a head tall@. But I have a clev@ face.
I am not good-look{g. I know I’m hideous, but I’ve a clev@ face. I
mu\n’t talk %o freely; if I fall {% h` arms all at }ce, he may
th{k—Tfoo! how horrible if he should th{k—!”

Such w@e # thoughts that exc~ed Kolya while he w= do{g h` utmo\ %
=sume # mo\ {dependent air. What di\ressed him mo\ w= h` be{g so
short; he did not m{d so much h` “hideous” face, = be{g so short. On
# wall { a corn@ at home he had # year before made a pencil-mark %
show h` height, & ev@y two m}ths s{ce he anxiously me=ured himself
aga{\ ~ % see how much he had ga{ed. But al=! he grew v@y slowly,
& th` sometimes reduced him almo\ % despair. H` face w= { real~y
by no means “hideous”; } # c}trary, ~ w= ra#r attractive, w~h a
fair, pale sk{, freckled. H` small, lively gray eyes had a fearless
look, & often glowed w~h feel{g. He had ra#r high cheekb}es; small,
v@y red, but not v@y thick, lips; h` nose w= small & unmi\akably
turned up. “I’ve a regular pug nose, a regular pug nose,” Kolya used %
mutt@ % himself when he looked { # look{g-gl=s, & he always left
~ w~h {dignati}. “But p@haps I haven’t got a clev@ face?” he
sometimes thought, doubtful even of that. But ~ mu\ not be supposed that
h` m{d w= preoccupied w~h h` face & h` height. On # c}trary,
howev@ b~t@ # moments before # look{g-gl=s w@e % him, he
quickly forgot #m, & forgot #m for a l}g time, “ab&}{g himself
entirely % ide= & % real life,” = he formulated ~ % himself.

Alyosha came out quickly & h=tened up % Kolya. Before he reached him,
Kolya could see that he looked delighted. “Can he be so glad % see me?”
Kolya w}d@ed, feel{g ple=ed. We may note h@e, { p=s{g, that
Alyosha’s appearance had und@g}e a complete change s{ce we saw him
l=t. He had ab&}ed h` c=sock & w= wear{g now a well-cut coat, a
soft, round hat, & h` hair had been cropped short. All th` w= v@y
becom{g % him, & he looked qu~e h&some. H` charm{g face always
had a good-humored expressi}; but #re w= a gentleness & s@en~y {
h` good-humor. To Kolya’s surpr`e, Alyosha came out % him ju\ = he
w=, w~hout an ov@coat. He had evidently come { h=te. He held out h`
h& % Kolya at }ce.

“H@e you are at l=t! How anxious we’ve been % see you!”

“$@e w@e re=}s which you shall know directly. Anyway, I am glad %
make your acqua{tance. I’ve l}g been hop{g for an opportun~y, & have
heard a great deal about you,” Kolya mutt@ed, a l~tle breathless.

“We should have met anyway. I’ve heard a great deal about you, %o; but
you’ve been a l}g time com{g h@e.”

“Tell me, how are th{gs go{g?”

“Ilusha ` v@y ill. He ` c@ta{ly dy{g.”

“How awful! You mu\ adm~ that medic{e ` a fraud, Karamazov,” cried
Kolya warmly.

“Ilusha h= menti}ed you often, v@y often, even { h` sleep, {
delirium, you know. One can see that you used % be v@y, v@y dear % him
... before # {cident ... w~h # knife.... $en #re’s ano#r
re=}.... Tell me, ` that your dog?”

“Yes, P@ezv}.”

“Not Zhutchka?” Alyosha looked at Kolya w~h eyes full of p~y. “Is she
lo\ for ev@?”

“I know you would all like ~ % be Zhutchka. I’ve heard all about ~.”
Kolya smiled my\@iously. “Li\en, Karamazov, I’ll tell you all about ~.
$at’s what I came for; that’s what I =ked you % come out h@e for, %
expla{ # whole ep`ode % you before we go {,” he began w~h
animati}. “You see, Karamazov, Ilusha came {% # prepara%ry cl=s
l=t spr{g. Well, you know what our prepara%ry cl=s `—a lot of small
boys. $ey began te={g Ilusha at }ce. I am two cl=ses high@ up, &,
of course, I }ly look } at #m from a di\ance. I saw # boy w= weak
& small, but he wouldn’t give { % #m; he fought w~h #m. I saw he
w= proud, & h` eyes w@e full of fire. I like children like that. And
#y te=ed him all # more. $e wor\ of ~ w= he w= horribly dressed
at # time, h` breeches w@e %o small for him, & #re w@e holes {
h` boots. $ey worried him about ~; #y je@ed at him. $at I can’t
\&. I s%od up for him at }ce, & gave ~ % #m hot. I beat #m,
but #y adore me, do you know, Karamazov?” Kolya bo=ted impulsively;
“but I am always f}d of children. I’ve two chickens { my h&s at home
now—that’s what deta{ed me %-day. So #y left off beat{g Ilusha & I
%ok him und@ my protecti}. I saw # boy w= proud. I tell you that,
# boy w= proud; but { # end he became slav`hly devoted % me: he
did my slighte\ bidd{g, obeyed me = though I w@e God, tried % copy
me. In # {t@vals between # cl=ses he used % run % me at }ce, &
I’d go about w~h him. On Sundays, %o. $ey always laugh when an old@
boy makes friends w~h a young@ }e like that; but that’s a prejudice. If
~’s my fancy, that’s enough. I am teach{g him, develop{g him. Why
shouldn’t I develop him if I like him? H@e you, Karamazov, have taken up
w~h all #se ne\l{gs. I see you want % {fluence # young@
gen@ati}—% develop #m, % be of use % #m, & I =sure you th`
tra~ { your charact@, which I knew by hearsay, attracted me more than
anyth{g. Let us get % # po{t, though. I noticed that #re w= a sort
of softness & sentimental~y com{g ov@ # boy, & you know I have a
pos~ive hatred of th` sheep`h sentimental~y, & I have had ~ from a
baby. $@e w@e c}tradicti}s { him, %o: he w= proud, but he w=
slav`hly devoted % me, & yet all at }ce h` eyes would fl=h & he’d
refuse % agree w~h me; he’d argue, fly {% a rage. I used sometimes %
propound c@ta{ ide=; I could see that ~ w= not so much that he
d`agreed w~h # ide=, but that he w= simply rebell{g aga{\ me,
because I w= cool { resp}d{g % h` endearments. And so, { ord@ %
tra{ him prop@ly, # tend@@ he w=, # cold@ I became. I did ~ }
purpose: that w= my idea. My object w= % form h` charact@, % lick
him {% shape, % make a man of him ... & besides ... no doubt, you
und@\& me at a word. Suddenly I noticed for three days { successi}
he w= downc=t & dejected, not because of my coldness, but for
someth{g else, someth{g more important. I w}d@ed what # tragedy w=.
I have pumped him & found out that he had somehow got % know
Sm@dyakov, who w= footman % your late fa#r—~ w= before h` death,
of course—& he taught # l~tle fool a silly trick—that `, a brutal,

& throw ~ % }e of those hungry dogs who snap up anyth{g w~hout

~ at all, though ~ barked all day. (Do you like that \upid bark{g,
Karamazov? I can’t \& ~.) So ~ rushed at # bread, swallowed ~, &
began % squeal; ~ turned round & round & ran away, squeal{g = ~

me, & cried b~t@ly. He hugged me, shak{g all ov@. He kept }
repeat{g ‘He ran away squeal{g’: # sight of that haunted him. He w=
%rmented by remorse, I could see that. I %ok ~ s@iously. I det@m{ed
% give him a less} for o#r th{gs = well. So I mu\ c}fess I w=n’t
qu~e \raightforward, & pretended % be more {dignant p@haps than I
w=. ‘You’ve d}e a n=ty th{g,’ I said, ‘you are a scoundrel. I w}’t

that I would not speak % him aga{. $at’s what we call ~ when two

Secretly I }ly meant % send him % Coventry for a few days & #n, if

c}tempt; whenev@ I met him I turned away or smiled sarc=tically. And
ju\ #n that affair w~h h` fa#r happened. You rememb@? You mu\
realize that he w= fearfully worked up by what had happened already. $e
boys, see{g I’d given him up, set } him & taunted him, shout{g, ‘W`p
of %w, w`p of %w!’ And he had so} regular skirm`hes w~h #m, which
I am v@y sorry for. $ey seem % have given him }e v@y bad beat{g. One

w= qu~e # o#r way, I felt awfully sorry for him, { ano#r m{ute I
would have run up % take h` part. But he suddenly met my eyes. I d}’t
know what he fancied; but he pulled out a penknife, rushed at me, &
\ruck at my thigh, h@e { my right leg. I didn’t move. I d}’t m{d
own{g I am plucky sometimes, Karamazov. I simply looked at him
c}temptuously, = though % say, ‘$` ` how you repay all my k{dness!
Do ~ aga{, if you like, I’m at your s@vice.’ But he didn’t \ab me
aga{; he broke down, he w= frightened at what he had d}e, he threw away
# knife, bur\ out cry{g, & ran away. I did not sneak } him, of
course, & I made #m all keep quiet, so ~ shouldn’t come % # ears
of # m=t@s. I didn’t even tell my mo#r till ~ had healed up. And
# wound w= a m@e scratch. And #n I heard that # same day he’d been

am sorry for ~ now. But I had a special re=}. So now I’ve %ld you all
about ~ ... but I’m afraid ~ w= \upid of me.”

“Oh, what a p~y,” exclaimed Alyosha, w~h feel{g, “that I didn’t know
before what t@ms you w@e } w~h him, or I’d have come % you l}g ago
% beg you % go % him w~h me. Would you believe ~, when he w=
fev@`h he talked about you { delirium. I didn’t know how much you w@e
% him! And you’ve really not succeeded { f{d{g that dog? H` fa#r
& # boys have been hunt{g all ov@ # %wn for ~. Would you believe
~, s{ce he’s been ill, I’ve three times heard him repeat w~h tears,
‘It’s because I killed Zhutchka, fa#r, that I am ill now. God `
pun`h{g me for ~.’ He can’t get that idea out of h` head. And if #

would cure him. We have all re\ed our hopes } you.”

“Tell me, what made you hope that I should be # }e % f{d him?” Kolya
=ked, w~h great curios~y. “Why did you reck} } me ra#r than any }e
else?”

“$@e w= a report that you w@e look{g for # dog, & that you would
br{g ~ when you’d found ~. Smurov said someth{g of # sort. We’ve all
been try{g % p@suade Ilusha that # dog ` alive, that ~’s been seen.
$e boys brought him a live hare; he ju\ looked at ~, w~h a fa{t

fa#r h= ju\ th` moment come back, br{g{g him a m=tiff pup, hop{g
% comfort him w~h that; but I th{k ~ }ly makes ~ worse.”

“Tell me, Karamazov, what sort of man ` # fa#r? I know him, but what
do you make of him—a mountebank, a buffo}?”

“Oh, no; #re are people of deep feel{g who have been somehow crushed.
Buffo}@y { #m ` a form of resentful ir}y aga{\ those % whom #y
daren’t speak # truth, from hav{g been for years humiliated &

sometimes tragic { # extreme. H` whole life now ` cent@ed { Ilusha,
& if Ilusha dies, he will ei#r go mad w~h grief or kill himself. I
feel almo\ c@ta{ of that when I look at him now.”

“I und@\& you, Karamazov. I see you und@\& human nature,” Kolya
added, w~h feel{g.

“And = so} = I saw you w~h a dog, I thought ~ w= Zhutchka you w@e

“Wa~ a b~, Karamazov, p@haps we shall f{d ~ yet; but th` `

no ov@coat } { th` b~t@ cold. You see what an egoi\ I am. Oh, we

“D}’t trouble; ~ ` cold, but I d}’t often catch cold. Let us go {,

“Nikolay—Nikolay Ivanov~ch Kr=sotk{, or, = #y say { official

suddenly, “Of course I hate my name Nikolay.”

“Why so?”

“It’s so trivial, so ord{ary.”

“You are thirteen?” =ked Alyosha.

“No, fourteen—that `, I shall be fourteen v@y so}, { a fortnight. I’ll

heard # s%ry; but I w=n’t play{g for my own amusement, ~ w= for #
sake of # children, because #y couldn’t th{k of anyth{g % do by
#mselves. But #y’ve always got some silly tale. $` ` an awful %wn
for gossip, I can tell you.”

“But what if you had been play{g for your own amusement, what’s #
harm?”

“Come, I say, for my own amusement! You d}’t play horses, do you?”

“But you mu\ look at ~ like th`,” said Alyosha, smil{g. “Grown-up
people go % # #at@ & #re # adventures of all sorts of h@oes
are represented—sometimes #re are robb@s & battles, %o—& `n’t
that ju\ # same th{g, { a diff@ent form, of course? And young

{ # #at@, # }ly diff@ence ` that people go #re % look at #

But that’s }ly natural.”

“You th{k so? Is that your idea?” Kolya looked at him {tently. “Oh, you

ov@. I’ll adm~ I thought I might learn someth{g from you. I’ve come %

feel{g.

“And I of you,” said Alyosha, smil{g & press{g h` h&.

Kolya w= much ple=ed w~h Alyosha. What \ruck him mo\ w= that he
treated him exactly like an equal & that he talked % him ju\ = if he
w@e “qu~e grown up.”

“I’ll show you someth{g directly, Karamazov; ~’s a #atrical

“Let us go fir\ % # people of # house, } # left. All # boys

“Oh, I’m }ly com{g { for a m{ute. I’ll keep } my ov@coat. P@ezv}

$$ V. By Ilusha’s Bedside


$e room {hab~ed by # family of # retired capta{ Snegiryov `
already familiar % # read@. It w= close & crowded at that moment
w~h a numb@ of v`i%rs. Sev@al boys w@e s~t{g w~h Ilusha, &
though all of #m, like Smurov, w@e prepared % deny that ~ w= Alyosha
who had brought #m & rec}ciled #m w~h Ilusha, ~ w= really #

Ilusha, w~hout “sheep`h sentimental~y,” appear{g % do so c=ually &
w~hout design. It w= a great c}solati} % Ilusha { h` suff@{g. He
w= greatly %uched by see{g # almo\ tend@ affecti} & sympathy
shown him by #se boys, who had been h` enemies. Kr=sotk{ w= # }ly
}e m`s{g & h` absence w= a heavy load } Ilusha’s heart. P@haps
# b~t@e\ of all h` b~t@ memories w= h` \abb{g Kr=sotk{, who
had been h` }e friend & protec%r. Clev@ l~tle Smurov, who w= #
fir\ % make ~ up w~h Ilusha, thought ~ w= so. But when Smurov h{ted
% Kr=sotk{ that Alyosha wanted % come & see him about someth{g, #
latt@ cut him short, bidd{g Smurov tell “Karamazov” at }ce that he knew
be\ what % do, that he wanted no }e’s advice, & that, if he went %
see Ilusha, he would choose h` own time for he had “h` own re=}s.”

$at w= a fortnight before th` Sunday. $at w= why Alyosha had not been
% see him, = he had meant %. But though he wa~ed, he sent Smurov %
him twice aga{. Both times Kr=sotk{ met him w~h a curt, impatient
refusal, send{g Alyosha a message not % bo#r him any more, that if he
came himself, he, Kr=sotk{, would not go % Ilusha at all. Up % #
v@y l=t day, Smurov did not know that Kolya meant % go % Ilusha that
morn{g, & }ly # even{g before, = he parted from Smurov, Kolya
abruptly %ld him % wa~ at home for him next morn{g, for he would go
w~h him % # Snegiryovs’, but warned him } no account % say he w=
com{g, = he wanted % drop { c=ually. Smurov obeyed. Smurov’s fancy
that Kolya would br{g back # lo\ dog w= b=ed } # words Kolya had
dropped that “#y mu\ be =ses not % f{d # dog, if ~ w= alive.”
When Smurov, wa~{g for an opportun~y, timidly h{ted at h` guess about
# dog, Kr=sotk{ flew {% a violent rage. “I’m not such an =s = %
go hunt{g about # %wn for o#r people’s dogs when I’ve got a dog of
my own! And how can you imag{e a dog could be alive aft@ swallow{g a
p{? Sheep`h sentimental~y, that’s what ~ `!”

For # l=t fortnight Ilusha had not left h` l~tle bed und@ # ik}s
{ # corn@. He had not been % school s{ce # day he met Alyosha &
b~ h` f{g@. He w= taken ill # same day, though for a m}th
aft@wards he w= sometimes able % get up & walk about # room &
p=sage. But latt@ly he had become so weak that he could not move w~hout
help from h` fa#r. H` fa#r w= t@ribly c}c@ned about him. He even
gave up dr{k{g & w= almo\ crazy w~h t@ror that h` boy would die.
And often, especially aft@ lead{g him round # room } h` arm &
putt{g him back % bed, he would run % a dark corn@ { # p=sage &,
lean{g h` head aga{\ # wall, he would break {% paroxysms of
violent weep{g, \ifl{g h` sobs that #y might not be heard by Ilusha.

Return{g % # room, he would usually beg{ do{g someth{g % amuse &
comfort h` precious boy; he would tell him s%ries, funny anecdotes, or
would mimic comic people he had happened % meet, even im~ate # howls
& cries of animals. But Ilusha could not bear % see h` fa#r fool{g
& play{g # buffo}. $ough # boy tried not % show how he d`liked
~, he saw w~h an ach{g heart that h` fa#r w= an object of c}tempt,
& he w= c}t{ually haunted by # memory of # “w`p of %w” & that
“t@rible day.”

N{a, Ilusha’s gentle, crippled si\@, did not like h@ fa#r’s
buffo}@y ei#r (Varvara had been g}e for some time p=t % Pet@sburg
% \udy at # univ@s~y). But # half-imbecile mo#r w= greatly
div@ted & laughed heartily when h@ husb& began cap@{g about or
p@form{g someth{g. It w= # }ly way she could be amused; all #
re\ of # time she w= grumbl{g & compla{{g that now ev@y }e had
forgotten h@, that no }e treated h@ w~h respect, that she w=
slighted, & so }. But dur{g # l=t few days she had completely
changed. She began look{g c}\antly at Ilusha’s bed { # corn@ &
seemed lo\ { thought. She w= more silent, quiet@, &, if she cried,
she cried quietly so = not % be heard. $e capta{ noticed # change {
h@ w~h mournful p@plex~y. $e boys’ v`~s at fir\ }ly ang@ed h@,
but lat@ } #ir m@ry shouts & s%ries began % div@t h@, & at
l=t she liked #m so much that, if # boys had given up com{g, she
would have felt dreary w~hout #m. When # children %ld some s%ry or
played a game, she laughed & clapped h@ h&s. She called some of #m
% h@ & k`sed #m. She w= particularly f}d of Smurov.

As for # capta{, # presence { h` room of # children, who came %
che@ up Ilusha, filled h` heart from # fir\ w~h ec\atic joy. He
even hoped that Ilusha would now get ov@ h` depressi}, & that that
would h=ten h` recov@y. In sp~e of h` alarm about Ilusha, he had not,
till lately, felt }e m{ute’s doubt of h` boy’s ultimate recov@y.

He met h` l~tle v`i%rs w~h homage, wa~ed up} #m h& & foot; he
w= ready % be #ir horse & even began lett{g #m ride } h` back,
but Ilusha did not like # game & ~ w= given up. He began buy{g
l~tle th{gs for #m, g{g@bread & nuts, gave #m tea & cut #m
s&wiches. It mu\ be noted that all th` time he had plenty of m}ey. He
had taken # two hundred roubles from Kat@{a Ivanovna ju\ = Alyosha
had predicted he would. And aft@wards Kat@{a Ivanovna, learn{g more
about #ir circum\ances & Ilusha’s illness, v`~ed #m h@self, made
# acqua{tance of # family, & succeeded { f=c{at{g # half-
imbecile mo#r. S{ce #n she had been lav`h { help{g #m, & #
capta{, t@ror-\ricken at # thought that h` boy might be dy{g,
forgot h` pride & humbly accepted h@ =si\ance.

All th` time Doc%r H@zen\ube, who w= called { by Kat@{a Ivanovna,
came punctually ev@y o#r day, but l~tle w= ga{ed by h` v`~s &
he dosed # {valid m@cilessly. But } that Sunday morn{g a new doc%r
w= expected, who had come from Moscow, wh@e he had a great reputati}.
Kat@{a Ivanovna had sent for him from Moscow at great expense, not
expressly for Ilusha, but for ano#r object of which more will be said {
~s place h@eaft@. But, = he had come, she had =ked him % see Ilusha
= well, & # capta{ had been %ld % expect him. He hadn’t #
slighte\ idea that Kolya Kr=sotk{ w= com{g, though he had l}g w`hed
for a v`~ from # boy for whom Ilusha w= frett{g.

At # moment when Kr=sotk{ opened # door & came {% # room, #
capta{ & all # boys w@e round Ilusha’s bed, look{g at a t{y
m=tiff pup, which had }ly been born # day before, though # capta{
had bespoken ~ a week ago % comfort & amuse Ilusha, who w= \ill
frett{g ov@ # lo\ & probably dead Zhutchka. Ilusha, who had heard
three days before that he w= % be presented w~h a puppy, not an
ord{ary puppy, but a pedigree m=tiff (a v@y important po{t, of
course), tried from delicacy of feel{g % pretend that he w= ple=ed.
But h` fa#r & # boys could not help see{g that # puppy }ly
s@ved % recall % h` l~tle heart # thought of # unhappy dog he had
killed. $e puppy lay beside him feebly mov{g & he, smil{g sadly,
\roked ~ w~h h` th{, pale, w=ted h&. Clearly he liked # puppy,
but ... ~ w=n’t Zhutchka; if he could have had Zhutchka & # puppy,
%o, #n he would have been completely happy.

“Kr=sotk{!” cried }e of # boys suddenly. He w= # fir\ % see him
come {.

Kr=sotk{’s entrance made a gen@al sensati}; # boys moved away &
s%od } each side of # bed, so that he could get a full view of Ilusha.
$e capta{ ran eag@ly % meet Kolya.

“Ple=e come { ... you are welcome!” he said hurriedly. “Ilusha, Mr.
Kr=sotk{ h= come % see you!”

But Kr=sotk{, shak{g h&s w~h him hurriedly, {\antly showed h`
complete knowledge of # mann@s of good society. He turned fir\ % #
capta{’s wife s~t{g { h@ arm-chair, who w= v@y ill-humored at #
moment, & w= grumbl{g that # boys s%od between h@ & Ilusha’s bed
& did not let h@ see # new puppy. W~h # greate\ courtesy he made
h@ a bow, scrap{g h` foot, & turn{g % N{a, he made h@, = #
}ly o#r lady present, a similar bow. $` pol~e behavior made an
extremely favorable impressi} } # d@anged lady.

“$@e, you can see at }ce he ` a young man that h= been well brought
up,” she commented aloud, throw{g up h@ h&s; “but = for our o#r
v`i%rs #y come { }e } # %p of ano#r.”

“How do you mean, mamma, }e } # %p of ano#r, how ` that?” mutt@ed
# capta{ affecti}ately, though a l~tle anxious } h@ account.

“$at’s how #y ride {. $ey get } each o#r’s should@s { #
p=sage & prance { like that } a respectable family. Strange sort of
v`i%rs!”

“But who’s come { like that, mamma?”

“Why, that boy came { rid{g } that }e’s back & th` }e } that
}e’s.”

Kolya w= already by Ilusha’s bedside. $e sick boy turned v`ibly pal@.
He ra`ed himself { # bed & looked {tently at Kolya. Kolya had not
seen h` l~tle friend for two m}ths, & he w= ov@whelmed at # sight
of him. He had nev@ imag{ed that he would see such a w=ted, yellow
face, such enormous, fev@`hly glow{g eyes & such th{ l~tle h&s.
He saw, w~h grieved surpr`e, Ilusha’s rapid, hard breath{g & dry
lips. He \epped close % him, held out h` h&, & almo\ ov@whelmed,
he said:

“Well, old man ... how are you?” But h` voice failed him, he couldn’t
achieve an appearance of e=e; h` face suddenly tw~ched & # corn@s
of h` mouth quiv@ed. Ilusha smiled a p~iful l~tle smile, \ill unable
% utt@ a word. Someth{g moved Kolya % ra`e h` h& & p=s ~ ov@
Ilusha’s hair.

“Nev@ m{d!” he murmured softly % him % che@ him up, or p@haps not
know{g why he said ~. For a m{ute #y w@e silent aga{.

“Hallo, so you’ve got a new puppy?” Kolya said suddenly, { a mo\ callous
voice.

“Ye—es,” answ@ed Ilusha { a l}g wh`p@, g=p{g for breath.

“A black nose, that means he’ll be fi@ce, a good house-dog,” Kolya
obs@ved gravely & s%lidly, = if # }ly th{g he cared about w= #
puppy & ~s black nose. But { real~y he \ill had % do h` utmo\ %
c}trol h` feel{gs not % bur\ out cry{g like a child, & do what he
would he could not c}trol ~. “When ~ grows up, you’ll have % keep ~
} # cha{, I’m sure.”

“He’ll be a huge dog!” cried }e of # boys.

“Of course he will,” “a m=tiff,” “large,” “like th`,” “= big = a
calf,” shouted sev@al voices.

“As big = a calf, = a real calf,” chimed { # capta{. “I got }e like
that } purpose, }e of # fi@ce\ breed, & h` parents are huge &
v@y fi@ce, #y \& = high = th` from # floor.... S~ down h@e,

% see you a l}g time.... You w@e so k{d = % come w~h Alexey
Fyodorov~ch?”

Kr=sotk{ sat } # edge of # bed, at Ilusha’s feet. $ough he had
p@haps prepared a free-&-e=y open{g for # c}v@sati} } h` way,
now he completely lo\ # thread of ~.

“No ... I came w~h P@ezv}. I’ve got a dog now, called P@ezv}. A
Slav}ic name. He’s out #re ... if I whi\le, he’ll run {. I’ve brought
a dog, %o,” he said, address{g Ilusha all at }ce. “Do you rememb@
Zhutchka, old man?” he suddenly fired # que\i} at him.

Ilusha’s l~tle face quiv@ed. He looked w~h an ag}ized expressi} at
Kolya. Alyosha, \&{g at # door, frowned & signed % Kolya not %
speak of Zhutchka, but he did not or would not notice.

“Wh@e ... ` Zhutchka?” Ilusha =ked { a broken voice.

“Oh, well, my boy, your Zhutchka’s lo\ & d}e for!”

Ilusha did not speak, but he fixed an {tent gaze }ce more } Kolya.
Alyosha, catch{g Kolya’s eye, signed % him vigorously aga{, but he
turned away h` eyes pretend{g not % have noticed.

“It mu\ have run away & died somewh@e. It mu\ have died aft@ a meal
like that,” Kolya pr}ounced p~ilessly, though he seemed a l~tle
breathless. “But I’ve got a dog, P@ezv} ... A Slav}ic name.... I’ve
brought him % show you.”

“I d}’t want him!” said Ilusha suddenly.

“No, no, you really mu\ see him ... ~ will amuse you. I brought him }
purpose.... He’s # same sort of shaggy dog.... You allow me % call {
my dog, madam?” He suddenly addressed Madame Snegiryov, w~h {explicable
exc~ement { h` mann@.

“I d}’t want him, I d}’t want him!” cried Ilusha, w~h a mournful break
{ h` voice. $@e w= a reproachful light { h` eyes.

“You’d bett@,” # capta{ \arted up from # che\ by # wall } which
he had ju\ sat down, “you’d bett@ ... ano#r time,” he mutt@ed, but
Kolya could not be re\ra{ed. He hurriedly shouted % Smurov, “Open #
door,” & = so} = ~ w= open, he blew h` whi\le. P@ezv} d=hed
headl}g {% # room.

“Jump, P@ezv}, beg! Beg!” shouted Kolya, jump{g up, & # dog s%od

% ev@y }e: Ilusha \arted, lurched violently forward, bent ov@
P@ezv} & gazed at him, fa{t w~h suspense.

“It’s ... Zhutchka!” he cried suddenly, { a voice break{g w~h joy &
suff@{g.

“And who did you th{k ~ w=?” Kr=sotk{ shouted w~h all h` might, {
a r{g{g, happy voice, & bend{g down he seized # dog & lifted him
up % Ilusha.

“Look, old man, you see, bl{d of }e eye & # left ear ` %rn, ju\
# marks you described % me. It w= by that I found him. I found him
directly. He did not bel}g % any }e!” he expla{ed, turn{g quickly %
# capta{, % h` wife, % Alyosha & #n aga{ % Ilusha. “He used %

` so tend@ ... tend@@ than { men, much tend@@!” Kolya cried
impetuously, h` face glow{g & radiant w~h delight. Ilusha could not
speak. Wh~e = a sheet, he gazed open-mou#d at Kolya, w~h h` great
eyes almo\ \art{g out of h` head. And if Kr=sotk{, who had no
suspici} of ~, had known what a d`=trous & fatal effect such a

him % play such a trick } him. But Alyosha w= p@haps # }ly p@s}
{ # room who realized ~. As for # capta{ he behaved like a small

“Zhutchka! It’s Zhutchka!” he cried { a bl`sful voice, “Ilusha, th` `
Zhutchka, your Zhutchka! Mamma, th` ` Zhutchka!” He w= almo\ weep{g.

“And I nev@ guessed!” cried Smurov regretfully. “Bravo, Kr=sotk{! I
said he’d f{d # dog & h@e he’s found him.”

“H@e he’s found him!” ano#r boy repeated gleefully.

“Kr=sotk{’s a brick!” cried a third voice.

“He’s a brick, he’s a brick!” cried # o#r boys, & #y began
clapp{g.

“Wa~, wa~,” Kr=sotk{ did h` utmo\ % shout above #m all. “I’ll
tell you how ~ happened, that’s # whole po{t. I found him, I %ok him

haven’t you got any?”

$e capta{ ran across # p=sage % # l&lady, wh@e #ir cook{g

P@ezv}, “Dead!” And # dog immediately turned round & lay } h` back

p@formance w= “mamma.” She laughed at # dog & began snapp{g h@
f{g@s & call{g ~, “P@ezv}, P@ezv}!”

“Noth{g will make him get up, noth{g!” Kolya cried triumphantly, proud
of h` success. “He w}’t move for all # shout{g { # world, but if I
call % him, he’ll jump up { a m{ute. Ici, P@ezv}!” $e dog leapt up
& bounded about, wh{{g w~h delight. $e capta{ ran back w~h a piece
of cooked beef.

“Is ~ hot?” Kolya {quired hurriedly, w~h a bus{ess-like air, tak{g
# meat. “Dogs d}’t like hot th{gs. No, ~’s all right. Look,
ev@ybody, look, Ilusha, look, old man; why aren’t you look{g? He does
not look at him, now I’ve brought him.”

$e new trick c}si\ed { mak{g # dog \& moti}less w~h h` nose

dog had % \& w~hout mov{g, w~h # meat } h` nose, = l}g = h`
m=t@ chose % keep him, w~hout a movement, p@haps for half an hour.
But he kept P@ezv} }ly for a brief moment.

“Paid for!” cried Kolya, & # meat p=sed { a fl=h from # dog’s
nose % h` mouth. $e audience, of course, expressed enthusi=m &
surpr`e.

“Can you really have put off com{g all th` time simply % tra{ #
dog?” exclaimed Alyosha, w~h an {voluntary note of reproach { h`
voice.

“Simply for that!” answ@ed Kolya, w~h p@fect simplic~y. “I wanted %

“P@ezv}! P@ezv},” called Ilusha suddenly, snapp{g h` th{ f{g@s
& beck}{g % # dog.

“What ` ~? Let him jump up } # bed! _Ici_, P@ezv}!” Kolya slapped
# bed & P@ezv} darted up by Ilusha. $e boy threw both arms round
h` head & P@ezv} {\antly licked h` cheek. Ilusha crept close %
him, \retched himself out { bed & hid h` face { # dog’s shaggy
coat.

“Dear, dear!” kept exclaim{g # capta{. Kolya sat down aga{ } #
edge of # bed.

“Ilusha, I can show you ano#r trick. I’ve brought you a l~tle cann}.
You rememb@, I %ld you about ~ before & you said how much you’d like
% see ~. Well, h@e, I’ve brought ~ % you.”

And Kolya hurriedly pulled out of h` satchel # l~tle br}ze cann}. He
hurried, because he w= happy himself. Ano#r time he would have wa~ed
till # sensati} made by P@ezv} had p=sed off, now he hurried }
regardless of all c}sid@ati}. “You are all happy now,” he felt, “so
h@e’s someth{g % make you happi@!” He w= p@fectly enchanted himself.

“I’ve been covet{g th` th{g for a l}g while; ~’s for you, old man,

Kolya held # cann} { h` h& so that all could see & admire ~.

“I got ~ for you, for you! I’ve been keep{g ~ for you a l}g time,” he

“Oh, give ~ % me! No, give me # cann}!” mamma began begg{g like a

Kolya w= d`c}c@ted. $e capta{ fidgeted une=ily.

“Mamma, mamma,” he ran % h@, “# cann}’s yours, of course, but let
Ilusha have ~, because ~’s a present % him, but ~’s ju\ = good =

“No, I d}’t want ~ % bel}g % both of us, I want ~ % be m{e

“Take ~, mo#r, h@e, keep ~!” Ilusha cried. “Kr=sotk{, may I give ~
% my mo#r?” he turned % Kr=sotk{ w~h an implor{g face, = though
he w@e afraid he might be offended at h` giv{g h` present % some }e

“Of course you may,” Kr=sotk{ =sented heartily, &, tak{g # cann}
from Ilusha, he h&ed ~ himself % mamma w~h a pol~e bow. She w= so
%uched that she cried.

“Ilusha, darl{g, he’s # }e who loves h` mamma!” she said tend@ly,
& at }ce began wheel{g # cann} % & fro } h@ lap aga{.

“Mamma, let me k`s your h&.” $e capta{ darted up % h@ at }ce &
did so.

“And I nev@ saw such a charm{g fellow = th` nice boy,” said #
grateful lady, po{t{g % Kr=sotk{.

“And I’ll br{g you = much powd@ = you like, Ilusha. We make # powd@

%ge#r, mixed {% a p=te w~h wat@ & rubbed through a tammy
sieve—that’s how ~’s d}e.”

“Smurov %ld me about your powd@, }ly fa#r says ~’s not real
gunpowd@,” resp}ded Ilusha.

“Not real?” Kolya flushed. “It burns. I d}’t know, of course.”

“No, I didn’t mean that,” put { # capta{ w~h a guilty face. “I }ly
said that real powd@ ` not made like that, but that’s noth{g, ~ can be

“I d}’t know, you know be\. We lighted some { a pomatum pot, ~ burned

did you hear?” he turned % Ilusha.

“Yes,” answ@ed Ilusha. He li\ened % Kolya w~h immense {t@e\ &
enjoyment.

“We had prepared a whole bottle of ~ & he used % keep ~ und@ h`

$ey say I’m a ‘desp@ate charact@,’ ” Kolya smiled scornfully. “It all

“Ah, we’ve heard of that explo~ of yours, %o,” cried # capta{. “How

$e capta{ w= abject { h` flatt@y of Kolya.

“N—not particularly,” answ@ed Kolya carelessly. “What’s bl=ted my

turn{g aga{ % Ilusha. But though he =sumed an unc}c@ned air = he

“Ah! I heard about # goose!” Ilusha laughed, beam{g all ov@. “$ey
%ld me, but I didn’t und@\&. Did #y really take you % # court?”

“$e mo\ \upid, trivial affair, #y made a mounta{ of a molehill =
#y always do,” Kolya began carelessly. “I w= walk{g through #

“No, Heaven forbid, I am li\en{g,” said Alyosha w~h a mo\ good-natured

“My #ory, Karamazov, ` clear & simple,” he hurried } aga{, look{g

‘And what does # goose th{k about?’ he =ked. ‘Do you see that cart

‘Come }, #n,’ said I, ‘let’s try.’ ‘Let’s,’ he said. And ~ did not

“But you %ok him down about # found@s of Troy!” Smurov put {
suddenly, unmi\akably proud of Kr=sotk{ at such a moment. He w=
particularly ple=ed w~h # s%ry of # goose.

“Did you really take him down?” # capta{ {quired, { a flatt@{g way.
“On # que\i} who founded Troy? We heard of ~, Ilusha %ld me about ~
at # time.”

“He knows ev@yth{g, fa#r, he knows more than any of us!” put {
Ilusha; “he }ly pretends % be like that, but really he ` %p { ev@y
subject....”

Ilusha looked at Kolya w~h {f{~e happ{ess.

“Oh, that’s all n}sense about Troy, a trivial matt@. I c}sid@ th` an
unimportant que\i},” said Kolya w~h haughty humil~y. He had by now
completely recov@ed h` dign~y, though he w= \ill a l~tle une=y. He
felt that he w= greatly exc~ed & that he had talked about # goose,
for {\ance, w~h %o l~tle res@ve, while Alyosha had looked s@ious
& had not said a word all # time. And # va{ boy began by degrees %
have a rankl{g fear that Alyosha w= silent because he desp`ed him, &
thought he w= show{g off before him. If he dared % th{k anyth{g like
that Kolya would—

“I regard # que\i} = qu~e a trivial }e,” he rapped out aga{,
proudly.

“And I know who founded Troy,” a boy, who had not spoken before, said
suddenly, % # surpr`e of ev@y }e. He w= silent & seemed % be
shy. He w= a pretty boy of about eleven, called Kart=hov. He w= s~t{g
near # door. Kolya looked at him w~h dignified amazement.

$e fact w= that # ident~y of # found@s of Troy had become a secret
for # whole school, a secret which could }ly be d`cov@ed by read{g
Smaragdov, & no }e had Smaragdov but Kolya. One day, when Kolya’s back
w= turned, Kart=hov h=tily opened Smaragdov, which lay am}g Kolya’s
books, & immediately lighted } # p=sage relat{g % # foundati}
of Troy. $` w= a good time ago, but he felt une=y & could not br{g
himself % announce publicly that he %o knew who had founded Troy, afraid
of what might happen & of Kr=sotk{’s somehow putt{g him % shame ov@
~. But now he couldn’t resi\ say{g ~. For weeks he had been l}g{g
%.

“Well, who did found ~?” =ked Kolya, turn{g % him w~h haughty
sup@ciliousness. He saw from h` face that he really did know & at }ce
made up h` m{d how % take ~. $@e w=, so % speak, a d`cordant note
{ # gen@al harm}y.

“Troy w= founded by Teuc@, Dardanus, Ilius & Tros,” # boy rapped out
at }ce, & { # same {\ant he blushed, blushed so, that ~ w=
pa{ful % look at him. But # boys \ared at him, \ared at him for a
whole m{ute, & #n all # \ar{g eyes turned at }ce & w@e
f=tened up} Kolya, who w= \ill scann{g # audacious boy w~h
d`da{ful composure.

“In what sense did #y found ~?” he deigned % comment at l=t. “And
what ` meant by found{g a c~y or a \ate? What do #y do? Did #y go
& each lay a brick, do you suppose?”

$@e w= laught@. $e offend{g boy turned from p{k % crims}. He w=
silent & } # po{t of tears. Kolya held him so for a m{ute.

“Before you talk of a h`%rical event like # foundati} of a
nati}al~y, you mu\ fir\ und@\& what you mean by ~,” he adm}`hed
him { \@n, {c`ive %nes. “But I attach no c}sequence % #se old
wives’ tales & I d}’t th{k much of univ@sal h`%ry { gen@al,” he
added carelessly, address{g # company gen@ally.

“Univ@sal h`%ry?” # capta{ {quired, look{g almo\ scared.

“Yes, univ@sal h`%ry! It’s # \udy of # successive follies of
mank{d & noth{g more. $e }ly subjects I respect are ma#matics &
natural science,” said Kolya. He w= show{g off & he s%le a glance at
Alyosha; h` w= # }ly op{i} he w= afraid of #re. But Alyosha w=
\ill silent & \ill s@ious = before. If Alyosha had said a word ~
would have s%pped him, but Alyosha w= silent & “~ might be #
silence of c}tempt,” & that f{ally irr~ated Kolya.

“$e cl=sical languages, %o ... #y are simply madness, noth{g more.
You seem % d`agree w~h me aga{, Karamazov?”

“I d}’t agree,” said Alyosha, w~h a fa{t smile.

“$e \udy of # cl=sics, if you =k my op{i}, ` simply a police
me=ure, that’s simply why ~ h= been {troduced {% our schools.” By
degrees Kolya began % get breathless aga{. “Lat{ & Greek w@e
{troduced because #y are a bore & because #y \upefy # {tellect.
It w= dull before, so what could #y do % make th{gs dull@? It w=
senseless enough before, so what could #y do % make ~ more senseless?
So #y thought of Greek & Lat{. $at’s my op{i}, I hope I shall
nev@ change ~,” Kolya f{`hed abruptly. H` cheeks w@e flushed.

“$at’s true,” =sented Smurov suddenly, { a r{g{g %ne of c}victi}.
He had li\ened attentively.

“And yet he ` fir\ { Lat{ himself,” cried }e of # group of boys
suddenly.

“Yes, fa#r, he says that & yet he ` fir\ { Lat{,” echoed Ilusha.

“What of ~?” Kolya thought f~ % defend himself, though # pra`e w=
v@y sweet % him. “I am fagg{g away at Lat{ because I have %, because
I prom`ed my mo#r % p=s my exam{ati}, & I th{k that whatev@ you
do, ~’s worth do{g ~ well. But { my soul I have a profound c}tempt
for # cl=sics & all that fraud.... You d}’t agree, Karamazov?”

“Why ‘fraud’?” Alyosha smiled aga{.

“Well, all # cl=sical authors have been translated {% all languages,
so ~ w= not for # sake of \udy{g # cl=sics #y {troduced Lat{,
but solely = a police me=ure, % \upefy # {telligence. So what can
}e call ~ but a fraud?”

“Why, who taught you all th`?” cried Alyosha, surpr`ed at l=t.

“In # fir\ place I am capable of th{k{g for myself w~hout be{g
taught. Besides, what I said ju\ now about # cl=sics be{g translated
our teach@ Kolb=nikov h= said % # whole of # third cl=s.”

“$e doc%r h= come!” cried N{a, who had been silent till #n.

A carriage bel}g{g % Madame Hohlakov drove up % # gate. $e capta{,
who had been expect{g # doc%r all # morn{g, rushed headl}g out %
meet him. “Mamma” pulled h@self %ge#r & =sumed a dignified air.
Alyosha went up % Ilusha & began sett{g h` pillows \raight. N{a,
from h@ {valid chair, anxiously watched him putt{g # bed tidy. $e
boys hurriedly %ok leave. Some of #m prom`ed % come aga{ { #
even{g. Kolya called P@ezv} & # dog jumped off # bed.

“I w}’t go away, I w}’t go away,” Kolya said h=tily % Ilusha. “I’ll
wa~ { # p=sage & come back when # doc%r’s g}e, I’ll come back
w~h P@ezv}.”

But by now # doc%r had ent@ed, an important-look{g p@s} w~h l}g,
dark wh`k@s & a sh{y, shaven ch{, wear{g a bearsk{ coat. As he
crossed # threshold he s%pped, taken aback; he probably fancied he had
come % # wr}g place. “How ` th`? Wh@e am I?” he mutt@ed, not
remov{g h` coat nor h` peaked sealsk{ cap. $e crowd, # pov@ty of

capta{, bent double, w= bow{g low before him.

“It’s h@e, sir, h@e, sir,” he mutt@ed cr{g{gly; “~’s h@e, you’ve
come right, you w@e com{g % us...”

“Sne-gi-ryov?” # doc%r said loudly & pompously. “Mr. Snegiryov—`
that you?”

“$at’s me, sir!”

“Ah!”

$e doc%r looked round # room w~h a squeam`h air }ce more & threw

“Wh@e ` # patient?” he =ked emphatically.



$$ VI. Precoc~y


“What do you th{k # doc%r will say % him?” Kolya =ked quickly. “What
a repulsive mug, though, h=n’t he? I can’t endure medic{e!”

“Ilusha ` dy{g. I th{k that’s c@ta{,” answ@ed Alyosha, mournfully.

“$ey are rogues! Medic{e’s a fraud! I am glad % have made your
acqua{tance, though, Karamazov. I wanted % know you for a l}g time. I
am }ly sorry we meet { such sad circum\ances.”

Kolya had a great {cl{ati} % say someth{g even warm@ & more
dem}\rative, but he felt ill at e=e. Alyosha noticed th`, smiled, &
pressed h` h&.

“I’ve l}g learned % respect you = a rare p@s},” Kolya mutt@ed aga{,
falt@{g & unc@ta{. “I have heard you are a my\ic & have been {
# m}=t@y. I know you are a my\ic, but ... that h=n’t put me off.
C}tact w~h real life will cure you.... It’s always so w~h charact@s

“What do you mean by my\ic? Cure me of what?” Alyosha w= ra#r
=%n`hed.

“Oh, God & all # re\ of ~.”

“What, d}’t you believe { God?”

“Oh, I’ve noth{g aga{\ God. Of course, God ` }ly a hypo#s`, but
... I adm~ that He ` needed ... for # ord@ of # univ@se & all

added Kolya, beg{n{g % blush. He suddenly fancied that Alyosha might
th{k he w= try{g % show off h` knowledge & % prove that he w=
“grown up.” “I haven’t # slighte\ desire % show off my knowledge %
him,” Kolya thought {dignantly. And all of a sudden he felt horribly
annoyed.

“I mu\ c}fess I can’t endure ent@{g } such d`cussi}s,” he said w~h
a f{al air. “It’s possible for }e who doesn’t believe { God % love
mank{d, d}’t you th{k so? Voltaire didn’t believe { God & loved
mank{d?” (“I am at ~ aga{,” he thought % himself.)

“Voltaire believed { God, though not v@y much, I th{k, & I d}’t
th{k he loved mank{d v@y much ei#r,” said Alyosha quietly, gently,
& qu~e naturally, = though he w@e talk{g % some }e of h` own age,
or even old@. Kolya w= particularly \ruck by Alyosha’s apparent
diffidence about h` op{i} of Voltaire. He seemed % be leav{g #

“Have you read Voltaire?” Alyosha f{`hed.

“No, not % say read.... But I’ve read _C&ide_ { # Russian

aga{!)”

“And did you und@\& ~?”

“Oh, yes, ev@yth{g.... $at ` ... Why do you suppose I shouldn’t

am an {curable Sociali\,” he announced suddenly, apropos of noth{g.

“A Sociali\?” laughed Alyosha. “But when have you had time % become }e?
Why, I thought you w@e }ly thirteen?”

Kolya w{ced.

“In # fir\ place I am not thirteen, but fourteen, fourteen { a

“When you are old@, you’ll und@\& for yourself # {fluence of age

“Come, you want obedience & my\ic`m. You mu\ adm~ that # Chri\ian

“Ah, I know wh@e you read that, & I am sure some }e %ld you so!”
cried Alyosha.

“I say, what makes you th{k I read ~? And c@ta{ly no }e %ld me so. I

$@e’s no doubt about that.”

“Oh, wh@e, wh@e did you get that from? What fool have you made friends

“Come, # truth will out! It h= so chanced that I have often talked %

“Byel{sky? I d}’t rememb@. He h=n’t wr~ten that anywh@e.”

“If he didn’t wr~e ~, #y say he said ~. I heard that from a ... but

“And have you read Byel{sky?”

“Well, no ... I haven’t read all of him, but ... I read # p=sage about

“Didn’t go off w~h Onyeg{? Surely you d}’t ... und@\& that
already?”

“Why, you seem % take me for l~tle Smurov,” said Kolya, w~h a gr{ of
irr~ati}. “But ple=e d}’t suppose I am such a revoluti}i\. I often

“I mu\ own, #y’ve been at me % go, but I decl{ed. $at’s between

“Oh, no, I am not laugh{g & d}’t suppose for a moment that you are

“No, I haven’t read ~ yet, but I want % read ~. I have no prejudices,

“Oh, noth{g.”

“Tell me, Karamazov, have you an awful c}tempt for me?” Kolya rapped out

“Be so k{d = % tell me, w~hout beat{g about # bush.”

“I have a c}tempt for you?” Alyosha looked at him w}d@{g. “What for? I

“D}’t be anxious about my nature,” Kolya {t@rupted, not w~hout

schoolboy,’ he wr~es, ‘a map of # \ars, which he knows noth{g about,
& he will give you back # map next day w~h correcti}s } ~.’ No
knowledge & unbounded c}ce~—that’s what # G@man meant % say about
# Russian schoolboy.”

“Yes, that’s p@fectly right,” Kolya laughed suddenly, “exactly so! Bravo
# G@man! But he did not see # good side, what do you th{k? C}ce~
may be, that comes from youth, that will be corrected if need be, but, }
# o#r h&, #re ` an {dependent spir~ almo\ from childhood,
boldness of thought & c}victi}, & not # spir~ of #se sausage
mak@s, grovel{g before author~y.... But # G@man w= right all #
same. Bravo # G@man! But G@mans want \rangl{g all # same. $ough
#y are so good at science & learn{g #y mu\ be \rangled.”

“Strangled, what for?” smiled Alyosha.

“Well, p@haps I am talk{g n}sense, I agree. I am awfully child`h
sometimes, & when I am ple=ed about anyth{g I can’t re\ra{ myself
& am ready % talk any \uff. But, I say, we are chatt@{g away h@e
about noth{g, & that doc%r h= been a l}g time { #re. But p@haps
he’s exam{{g # mamma & that poor crippled N{a. I liked that N{a,
you know. She wh`p@ed % me suddenly = I w= com{g away, ‘Why didn’t
you come before?’ And { such a voice, so reproachfully! I th{k she `
awfully nice & pa#tic.”

“Yes, yes! Well, you’ll be com{g often, you will see what she ` like. It
would do you a great deal of good % know people like that, % learn %
value a great deal which you will f{d out from know{g #se people,”
Alyosha obs@ved warmly. “$at would have more effect } you than
anyth{g.”

“Oh, how I regret & blame myself for not hav{g come so}@!” Kolya
exclaimed, w~h b~t@ feel{g.

“Yes, ~’s a great p~y. You saw for yourself how delighted # poor child
w= % see you. And how he fretted for you % come!”

“D}’t tell me! You make ~ worse! But ~ s@ves me right. What kept me
from com{g w= my c}ce~, my egoi\ic van~y, & # be=tly
wilfullness, which I nev@ can get rid of, though I’ve been \ruggl{g
w~h ~ all my life. I see that now. I am a be=t { lots of ways,
Karamazov!”

“No, you have a charm{g nature, though ~’s been d`%rted, & I qu~e
und@\& why you have had such an {fluence } th` gen@ous, morbidly
sens~ive boy,” Alyosha answ@ed warmly.

“And you say that % me!” cried Kolya; “& would you believe ~, I
thought—I’ve thought sev@al times s{ce I’ve been h@e—that you desp`ed
me! If }ly you knew how I prize your op{i}!”

“But are you really so sens~ive? At your age! Would you believe ~, ju\
now, when you w@e tell{g your s%ry, I thought, = I watched you, that
you mu\ be v@y sens~ive!”

“You thought so? What an eye you’ve got, I say! I bet that w= when I w=

c}tempt for me for be{g { such a hurry % show off, & for a moment I
qu~e hated you for ~, & began talk{g like a fool. $en I fancied—ju\
now, h@e—when I said that if #re w@e no God He would have % be
{vented, that I w= { %o great a hurry % d`play my knowledge,
especially = I got that phr=e out of a book. But I swear I w=n’t
show{g off out of van~y, though I really d}’t know why. Because I w=
so ple=ed? Yes, I believe ~ w= because I w= so ple=ed ... though ~’s
p@fectly d`graceful for any }e % be gush{g directly #y are ple=ed,
I know that. But I am c}v{ced now that you d}’t desp`e me; ~ w= all

all sorts of th{gs, that ev@y }e ` laugh{g at me, # whole world,
& #n I feel ready % ov@turn # whole ord@ of th{gs.”

“And you worry ev@y }e about you,” smiled Alyosha.

“Yes, I worry ev@y }e about me, especially my mo#r. Karamazov, tell
me, am I v@y ridiculous now?”

“D}’t th{k about that, d}’t th{k of ~ at all!” cried Alyosha. “And
what does ridiculous mean? Isn’t ev@y }e c}\antly be{g or seem{g
ridiculous? Besides, nearly all clev@ people now are fearfully afraid of
be{g ridiculous, & that makes #m unhappy. All I am surpr`ed at `
that you should be feel{g that so early, though I’ve obs@ved ~ for some
time p=t, & not }ly { you. Nowadays # v@y children have begun %
suff@ from ~. It’s almo\ a sort of {san~y. $e devil h= taken #
form of that van~y & ent@ed {% # whole gen@ati}; ~’s simply #
devil,” added Alyosha, w~hout a trace of # smile that Kolya, \ar{g at
him, expected % see. “You are like ev@y }e else,” said Alyosha, {
c}clusi}, “that `, like v@y many o#rs. Only you mu\ not be like
ev@ybody else, that’s all.”

“Even if ev@y }e ` like that?”

“Yes, even if ev@y }e ` like that. You be # }ly }e not like ~. You
really are not like ev@y }e else, h@e you are not =hamed % c}fess %
someth{g bad & even ridiculous. And who will adm~ so much { #se

cr~ic`m. D}’t be like ev@y }e else, even if you are # }ly }e.”

“Splendid! I w= not mi\aken { you. You know how % c}sole }e. Oh, how
I have l}ged % know you, Karamazov! I’ve l}g been eag@ for th`
meet{g. Can you really have thought about me, %o? You said ju\ now that
you thought of me, %o?”

“Yes, I’d heard of you & had thought of you, %o ... & if ~’s partly
van~y that makes you =k, ~ doesn’t matt@.”

“Do you know, Karamazov, our talk h= been like a declarati} of love,”
said Kolya, { a b=hful & melt{g voice. “$at’s not ridiculous, `
~?”

“Not at all ridiculous, & if ~ w@e, ~ wouldn’t matt@, because ~’s
been a good th{g.” Alyosha smiled brightly.

“But do you know, Karamazov, you mu\ adm~ that you are a l~tle =hamed
yourself, now.... I see ~ by your eyes.” Kolya smiled w~h a sort of sly
happ{ess.

“Why =hamed?”

“Well, why are you blush{g?”

“It w= you made me blush,” laughed Alyosha, & he really did blush. “Oh,
well, I am a l~tle, goodness knows why, I d}’t know...” he mutt@ed,
almo\ embarr=sed.

“Oh, how I love you & admire you at th` moment ju\ because you are
ra#r =hamed! Because you are ju\ like me,” cried Kolya, { pos~ive
ec\=y. H` cheeks glowed, h` eyes beamed.

“You know, Kolya, you will be v@y unhappy { your life,” someth{g made
Alyosha say suddenly.

“I know, I know. How you know ~ all beforeh&!” Kolya agreed at }ce.

“But you will bless life } # whole, all # same.”

“Ju\ so, hurrah! You are a prophet. Oh, we shall get } %ge#r,
Karamazov! Do you know, what delights me mo\, ` that you treat me qu~e
like an equal. But we are not equals, no, we are not, you are bett@! But

“And say{g that, of course, you loved me,” Alyosha laughed gayly.

“I did. I loved you awfully. I’ve been lov{g & dream{g of you. And how

Book XI. Ivan



$$ I. At Grushenka’s


Alyosha went %wards # ca#dral square % # widow Morozov’s house %
see Grushenka, who had sent Fenya % him early { # morn{g w~h an
urgent message begg{g him % come. Que\i}{g Fenya, Alyosha learned
that h@ mi\ress had been particularly di\ressed s{ce # previous day.
Dur{g # two m}ths that had p=sed s{ce M~ya’s arre\, Alyosha had
called frequently at # widow Morozov’s house, both from h` own
{cl{ati} & % take messages for M~ya. $ree days aft@ M~ya’s
arre\, Grushenka w= taken v@y ill & w= ill for nearly five weeks.
For }e whole week she w= unc}scious. She w= v@y much changed—th{n@
& a l~tle sallow, though she had for # p=t fortnight been well
enough % go out. But % Alyosha h@ face w= even more attractive than
before, & he liked % meet h@ eyes when he went { % h@. A look of
firmness & {telligent purpose had developed { h@ face. $@e w@e
signs of a spir~ual transformati} { h@, & a \eadf=t, f{e &
humble det@m{ati} that noth{g could shake could be d`c@ned { h@.
$@e w= a small v@tical l{e between h@ brows which gave h@ charm{g
face a look of c}centrated thought, almo\ au\@e at # fir\ glance.
$@e w= scarcely a trace of h@ form@ frivol~y.

It seemed \range % Alyosha, %o, that { sp~e of # calam~y that had
ov@taken # poor girl, betro#d % a man who had been arre\ed for a
t@rible crime, almo\ at # {\ant of #ir betrothal, { sp~e of h@
illness & # almo\ {ev~able sentence hang{g ov@ M~ya, Grushenka
had not yet lo\ h@ youthful che@fulness. $@e w= a soft light { #
}ce proud eyes, though at times #y gleamed w~h # old v{dictive fire
when she w= v`~ed by }e di\urb{g thought \r}g@ than ev@ { h@
heart. $e object of that une={ess w= # same = ev@—Kat@{a
Ivanovna, of whom Grushenka had even raved when she lay { delirium.
Alyosha knew that she w= fearfully jealous of h@. Yet Kat@{a Ivanovna
had not }ce v`~ed M~ya { h` pr`}, though she might have d}e ~
whenev@ she liked. All th` made a difficult problem for Alyosha, for he
w= # }ly p@s} % whom Grushenka opened h@ heart & from whom she
w= c}t{ually =k{g advice. Sometimes he w= unable % say anyth{g.

Full of anxiety he ent@ed h@ lodg{g. She w= at home. She had returned
from see{g M~ya half an hour before, & from # rapid movement w~h
which she leapt up from h@ chair % meet him he saw that she had been
expect{g him w~h great impatience. A pack of cards dealt for a game of
“fools” lay } # table. A bed had been made up } # lea#r sofa }
# o#r side & Maximov lay, half-recl{{g, } ~. He wore a dress{g-
gown & a cot%n nightcap, & w= evidently ill & weak, though he w=
smil{g bl`sfully. When # homeless old man returned w~h Grushenka from
Mokroe two m}ths before, he had simply \ayed } & w= \ill \ay{g
w~h h@. He arrived w~h h@ { ra{ & sleet, sat down } # sofa,
drenched & scared, & gazed mutely at h@ w~h a timid, appeal{g
smile. Grushenka, who w= { t@rible grief & { # fir\ \age of
fev@, almo\ forgot h` exi\ence { all she had % do # fir\ half-
hour aft@ h@ arrival. Suddenly she chanced % look at him {tently: he
laughed a p~iful, helpless l~tle laugh. She called Fenya & %ld h@ %
give him someth{g % eat. All that day he sat { # same place, almo\
w~hout \irr{g. When ~ got dark & # shutt@s w@e closed, Fenya
=ked h@ mi\ress:

“Is # gentleman go{g % \ay # night, mi\ress?”

“Yes; make him a bed } # sofa,” answ@ed Grushenka.

Que\i}{g him more { detail, Grushenka learned from him that he had
l~@ally nowh@e % go, & that “Mr. Kalganov, my benefac%r, %ld me
\raight that he wouldn’t receive me aga{ & gave me five roubles.”

“Well, God bless you, you’d bett@ \ay, #n,” Grushenka decided { h@
grief, smil{g comp=si}ately at him. H@ smile wrung # old man’s heart
& h` lips tw~ched w~h grateful tears. And so # de\~ute w&@@
had \ayed w~h h@ ev@ s{ce. He did not leave # house even when she
w= ill. Fenya & h@ gr&mo#r, # cook, did not turn him out, but
went } s@v{g him meals & mak{g up h` bed } # sofa. Grushenka had
grown used % him, & com{g back from see{g M~ya (whom she had begun
% v`~ { pr`} before she w= really well) she would s~ down &
beg{ talk{g % “Maximushka” about trifl{g matt@s, % keep h@ from
th{k{g of h@ sorrow. $e old man turned out % be a good s%ry-tell@
} occ=i}s, so that at l=t he became necessary % h@. Grushenka saw
scarcely any }e else beside Alyosha, who did not come ev@y day & nev@
\ayed l}g. H@ old m@chant lay s@iously ill at th` time, “at h` l=t
g=p” = #y said { # %wn, & he did, { fact, die a week aft@
M~ya’s trial. $ree weeks before h` death, feel{g # end approach{g,
he made h` s}s, #ir wives & children, come up\airs % him at l=t
& bade #m not leave him aga{. From that moment he gave \rict ord@s
% h` s@vants not % adm~ Grushenka & % tell h@ if she came, “$e
m=t@ w`hes you l}g life & happ{ess & tells you % forget him.”
But Grushenka sent almo\ ev@y day % {quire aft@ him.

“You’ve come at l=t!” she cried, fl{g{g down # cards & joyfully
greet{g Alyosha, “& Maximushka’s been scar{g me that p@haps you
wouldn’t come. Ah, how I need you! S~ down % # table. What will you
have—coffee?”

“Yes, ple=e,” said Alyosha, s~t{g down at # table. “I am v@y
hungry.”

“$at’s right. Fenya, Fenya, coffee,” cried Grushenka. “It’s been made a
l}g time ready for you. And br{g some l~tle pies, & m{d #y are
hot. Do you know, we’ve had a s%rm ov@ those pies %-day. I %ok #m %
# pr`} for him, & would you believe ~, he threw #m back % me: he
would not eat #m. He flung }e of #m } # floor & \amped } ~.
So I said % him: ‘I shall leave #m w~h # ward@; if you d}’t eat
#m before even{g, ~ will be that your venomous sp~e ` enough for
you!’ W~h that I went away. We quarreled aga{, would you believe ~?
Whenev@ I go we quarrel.”

Grushenka said all th` { }e breath { h@ ag~ati}. Maximov, feel{g
n@vous, at }ce smiled & looked } # floor.

“What did you quarrel about th` time?” =ked Alyosha.

“I didn’t expect ~ { # le=t. Only fancy, he ` jealous of # Pole.
‘Why are you keep{g him?’ he said. ‘So you’ve begun keep{g him.’ He `
jealous, jealous of me all # time, jealous eat{g & sleep{g! He even
%ok ~ {% h` head % be jealous of Kuzma l=t week.”

“But he knew about # Pole before?”

“Yes, but #re ~ `. He h= known about him from # v@y beg{n{g, but
%-day he suddenly got up & began scold{g about him. I am =hamed %
repeat what he said. Silly fellow! Rak~{ went { = I came out. P@haps
Rak~{ ` egg{g him }. What do you th{k?” she added carelessly.

“He loves you, that’s what ~ `: he loves you so much. And now he `
particularly worried.”

“I should th{k he might be, w~h # trial %-morrow. And I went % him
% say someth{g about %-morrow, for I dread % th{k what’s go{g %
happen #n. You say that he ` worried, but how worried I am! And he
talks about # Pole! He’s %o silly! He ` not jealous of Maximushka yet,
anyway.”

“My wife w= dreadfully jealous ov@ me, %o,” Maximov put { h` word.

“Jealous of you?” Grushenka laughed { sp~e of h@self. “Of whom could
she have been jealous?”

“Of # s@vant girls.”

“Hold your %ngue, Maximushka, I am { no laugh{g mood now; I feel angry.
D}’t ogle # pies. I shan’t give you any; #y are not good for you, &
I w}’t give you any vodka ei#r. I have % look aft@ him, %o, ju\ =
though I kept an almshouse,” she laughed.

“I d}’t des@ve your k{dness. I am a worthless creature,” said Maximov,

“Ech, ev@y }e ` of use, Maximushka, & how can we tell who’s of mo\

~, so now I shall send some! Ah, h@e’s Fenya w~h a lett@! Yes, ~’s
from # Poles—begg{g aga{!”

Pan Mussyalov~ch had {deed sent an extremely l}g & charact@i\ically
eloquent lett@ { which he begged h@ % lend him three roubles. In #
lett@ w= enclosed a receipt for # sum, w~h a prom`e % repay ~
w~h{ three m}ths, signed by Pan Vrublevsky = well. Grushenka had
received many such lett@s, accompanied by such receipts, from h@ form@
lov@ dur{g # fortnight of h@ c}valescence. But she knew that # two
Poles had been % =k aft@ h@ health dur{g h@ illness. $e fir\
lett@ Grushenka got from #m w= a l}g }e, wr~ten } large notepap@
& w~h a big family cre\ } # seal. It w= so obscure & rhe%rical
that Grushenka put ~ down before she had read half, unable % make head
or tail of ~. She could not attend % lett@s #n. $e fir\ lett@ w=
followed next day by ano#r { which Pan Mussyalov~ch begged h@ for a
loan of two thous& roubles for a v@y short p@iod. Grushenka left that
lett@, %o, unansw@ed. A whole s@ies of lett@s had followed—}e ev@y
day—all = pompous & rhe%rical, but # loan =ked for, gradually
dim{`h{g, dropped % a hundred roubles, #n % twenty-five, % ten,
& f{ally Grushenka received a lett@ { which both # Poles begged h@
for }ly }e rouble & {cluded a receipt signed by both.

$en Grushenka suddenly felt sorry for #m, & at dusk she went round
h@self % #ir lodg{g. She found # two Poles { great pov@ty, almo\
de\~uti}, w~hout food or fuel, w~hout cigarettes, { debt % #ir
l&lady. $e two hundred roubles #y had carried off from M~ya at
Mokroe had so} d`appeared. But Grushenka w= surpr`ed at #ir meet{g
h@ w~h arrogant dign~y & self-=s@ti}, w~h # greate\ punctilio
& pompous speeches. Grushenka simply laughed, & gave h@ form@
admir@ ten roubles. $en, laugh{g, she %ld M~ya of ~ & he w= not
{ # le=t jealous. But ev@ s{ce, # Poles had attached #mselves %
Grushenka & bombarded h@ daily w~h reque\s for m}ey & she had
always sent #m small sums. And now that day M~ya had taken ~ {% h`
head % be fearfully jealous.

“Like a fool, I went round % him ju\ for a m{ute, } # way % see
M~ya, for he ` ill, %o, my Pole,” Grushenka began aga{ w~h n@vous
h=te. “I w= laugh{g, tell{g M~ya about ~. ‘Fancy,’ I said, ‘my Pole
had # happy thought % s{g h` old s}gs % me % # gu~ar. He
thought I would be %uched & marry him!’ M~ya leapt up swear{g.... So,
#re, I’ll send #m # pies! Fenya, ` ~ that l~tle girl #y’ve
sent? H@e, give h@ three roubles & pack a dozen pies up { a pap@ &
tell h@ % take #m. And you, Alyosha, be sure % tell M~ya that I did
send #m # pies.”

“I wouldn’t tell him for anyth{g,” said Alyosha, smil{g.

“Ech! You th{k he ` unhappy about ~. Why, he’s jealous } purpose. He
doesn’t care,” said Grushenka b~t@ly.

“On purpose?” qu@ied Alyosha.

“I tell you you are silly, Alyosha. You know noth{g about ~, w~h all
your clev@ness. I am not offended that he ` jealous of a girl like me. I
would be offended if he w@e not jealous. I am like that. I am not
offended at jealousy. I have a fi@ce heart, %o. I can be jealous myself.
Only what offends me ` that he doesn’t love me at all. I tell you he `
jealous now _} purpose_. Am I bl{d? D}’t I see? He began talk{g % me
ju\ now of that woman, of Kat@{a, say{g she w= th` & that, how she
had ord@ed a doc%r from Moscow for him, % try & save him; how she had
ord@ed # be\ counsel, # mo\ learned }e, %o. So he loves h@, if
he’ll pra`e h@ % my face, more shame % him! He’s treated me badly
himself, so he attacked me, % make out I am { fault fir\ & % throw
~ all } me. ‘You w@e w~h your Pole before me, so I can’t be blamed for
Kat@{a,’ that’s what ~ amounts %. He wants % throw # whole blame }
me. He attacked me } purpose, } purpose, I tell you, but I’ll—”

Grushenka could not f{`h say{g what she would do. She hid h@ eyes {
h@ h&k@chief & sobbed violently.

“He doesn’t love Kat@{a Ivanovna,” said Alyosha firmly.

“Well, whe#r he loves h@ or not, I’ll so} f{d out for myself,” said
Grushenka, w~h a menac{g note { h@ voice, tak{g # h&k@chief from
h@ eyes. H@ face w= d`%rted. Alyosha saw sorrowfully that from be{g
mild & s@ene, ~ had become sullen & sp~eful.

“Enough of th` fool`hness,” she said suddenly; “~’s not for that I sent
for you. Alyosha, darl{g, %-morrow—what will happen %-morrow? $at’s
what worries me! And ~’s }ly me ~ worries! I look at ev@y }e & no
}e ` th{k{g of ~. No }e cares about ~. Are you th{k{g about ~
even? To-morrow he’ll be tried, you know. Tell me, how will he be tried?
You know ~’s # valet, # valet killed him! Good heavens! Can #y
c}demn him { place of # valet & will no }e \& up for him? $ey
haven’t troubled # valet at all, have #y?”

“He’s been sev@ely cross-exam{ed,” obs@ved Alyosha thoughtfully; “but
ev@y }e came % # c}clusi} ~ w= not he. Now he ` ly{g v@y ill.
He h= been ill ev@ s{ce that attack. Really ill,” added Alyosha.

“Oh, dear! couldn’t you go % that counsel yourself & tell him # whole
th{g by yourself? He’s been brought from Pet@sburg for three thous&
roubles, #y say.”

“We gave #se three thous& %ge#r—Ivan, Kat@{a Ivanovna & I—but
she paid two thous& for # doc%r from Moscow h@self. $e counsel
Fetyukov~ch would have charged more, but # c=e h= become known all
ov@ Russia; ~’s talked of { all # pap@s & journals. Fetyukov~ch
agreed % come more for # glory of # th{g, because # c=e h=
become so no%rious. I saw him ye\@day.”

“Well? Did you talk % him?” Grushenka put { eag@ly.

“He li\ened & said noth{g. He %ld me that he had already formed h`
op{i}. But he prom`ed % give my words c}sid@ati}.”

“C}sid@ati}! Ah, #y are sw{dl@s! $ey’ll ru{ him. And why did she
send for # doc%r?”

“As an exp@t. $ey want % prove that M~ya’s mad & comm~ted #
murd@ when he didn’t know what he w= do{g”; Alyosha smiled gently; “but
M~ya w}’t agree % that.”

“Yes; but that would be # truth if he had killed him!” cried Grushenka.
“He w= mad #n, p@fectly mad, & that w= my fault, wretch that I am!
But, of course, he didn’t do ~, he didn’t do ~! And #y are all aga{\
him, # whole %wn. Even Fenya’s evidence went % prove he had d}e ~.
And # people at # shop, & that official, & at # tav@n, %o,
before, people had heard him say so! $ey are all, all aga{\ him, all
cry{g out aga{\ him.”

“Yes, #re’s a fearful accumulati} of evidence,” Alyosha obs@ved
grimly.

“And Grigory—Grigory V=silyev~ch—\icks % h` s%ry that # door w=
open, p@si\s that he saw ~—#re’s no shak{g him. I went & talked %
him myself. He’s rude about ~, %o.”

“Yes, that’s p@haps # \r}ge\ evidence aga{\ him,” said Alyosha.

“And = for M~ya’s be{g mad, he c@ta{ly seems like ~ now,” Grushenka
began w~h a peculiarly anxious & my\@ious air. “Do you know, Alyosha,
I’ve been want{g % talk % you about ~ for a l}g time. I go % him
ev@y day & simply w}d@ at him. Tell me, now, what do you suppose he’s
always talk{g about? He talks & talks & I can make noth{g of ~. I
fancied he w= talk{g of someth{g {tellectual that I couldn’t
und@\& { my fool`hness. Only he suddenly began talk{g % me about a
babe—that `, about some child. ‘Why ` # babe poor?’ he said. ‘It’s for
that babe I am go{g % Sib@ia now. I am not a murd@@, but I mu\ go %
Sib@ia!’ What that meant, what babe, I couldn’t tell for # life of me.
Only I cried when he said ~, because he said ~ so nicely. He cried
himself, & I cried, %o. He suddenly k`sed me & made # sign of #
cross ov@ me. What did ~ mean, Alyosha, tell me? What ` th` babe?”

“It mu\ be Rak~{, who’s been go{g % see him lately,” smiled Alyosha,
“though ... that’s not Rak~{’s do{g. I didn’t see M~ya ye\@day. I’ll
see him %-day.”

“No, ~’s not Rak~{; ~’s h` bro#r Ivan Fyodorov~ch upsett{g him.
It’s h` go{g % see him, that’s what ~ `,” Grushenka began, &
suddenly broke off. Alyosha gazed at h@ { amazement.

“Ivan’s go{g? H= he been % see him? M~ya %ld me himself that Ivan
h=n’t been }ce.”

“$@e ... #re! What a girl I am! Blurt{g th{gs out!” exclaimed
Grushenka, c}fused & suddenly blush{g. “Stay, Alyosha, hush! S{ce
I’ve said so much I’ll tell # whole truth—he’s been % see him twice,
# fir\ directly he arrived. He galloped h@e from Moscow at }ce, of
course, before I w= taken ill; & # sec}d time w= a week ago. He
%ld M~ya not % tell you about ~, und@ any circum\ances; & not %
tell any }e, { fact. He came secretly.”

Alyosha sat plunged { thought, c}sid@{g someth{g. $e news evidently
impressed him.

“Ivan doesn’t talk % me of M~ya’s c=e,” he said slowly. “He’s said v@y
l~tle % me #se l=t two m}ths. And whenev@ I go % see him, he seems
vexed at my com{g, so I’ve not been % him for # l=t three weeks.
H’m!... if he w= #re a week ago ... #re c@ta{ly h= been a change
{ M~ya th` week.”

“$@e h= been a change,” Grushenka =sented quickly. “$ey have a
secret, #y have a secret! M~ya %ld me himself #re w= a secret, &
such a secret that M~ya can’t re\. Before #n, he w= che@ful—&,
{deed, he ` che@ful now—but when he shakes h` head like that, you
know, & \rides about # room & keeps pull{g at # hair } h`
right temple w~h h` right h&, I know #re ` someth{g } h` m{d
worry{g him.... I know! He w= che@ful before, though, {deed, he `
che@ful %-day.”

“But you said he w= worried.”

“Yes, he ` worried & yet che@ful. He keeps } be{g irr~able for a
m{ute & #n che@ful & #n irr~able aga{. And you know, Alyosha,
I am c}\antly w}d@{g at him—w~h th` awful th{g hang{g ov@ him,
he sometimes laughs at such trifles = though he w@e a baby himself.”

“And did he really tell you not % tell me about Ivan? Did he say, ‘D}’t
tell him’?”

“Yes, he %ld me, ‘D}’t tell him.’ It’s you that M~ya’s mo\ afraid of.
Because ~’s a secret: he said himself ~ w= a secret. Alyosha, darl{g,
go % him & f{d out what #ir secret ` & come & tell me,”
Grushenka besought him w~h sudden eag@ness. “Set my m{d at re\ that I
may know # wor\ that’s { s%re for me. $at’s why I sent for you.”

“You th{k ~’s someth{g % do w~h you? If ~ w@e, he wouldn’t have
%ld you #re w= a secret.”

“I d}’t know. P@haps he wants % tell me, but doesn’t dare %. He warns
me. $@e ` a secret, he tells me, but he w}’t tell me what ~ `.”

“What do you th{k yourself?”

“What do I th{k? It’s # end for me, that’s what I th{k. $ey all three
have been plott{g my end, for Kat@{a’s { ~. It’s all Kat@{a, ~ all
comes from h@. She ` th` & that, & that means that I am not. He
tells me that beforeh&—warns me. He ` plann{g % throw me ov@, that’s
# whole secret. $ey’ve planned ~ %ge#r, # three of #m—M~ya,
Kat@{a, & Ivan Fyodorov~ch. Alyosha, I’ve been want{g % =k you a
l}g time. A week ago he suddenly %ld me that Ivan w= { love w~h
Kat@{a, because he often goes % see h@. Did he tell me # truth or
not? Tell me, } your c}science, tell me # wor\.”

“I w}’t tell you a lie. Ivan ` not { love w~h Kat@{a Ivanovna, I
th{k.”

“Oh, that’s what I thought! He ` ly{g % me, shameless deceiv@, that’s
what ~ `! And he w= jealous of me ju\ now, so = % put # blame }
me aft@wards. He ` \upid, he can’t d`gu`e what he ` do{g; he ` so
open, you know.... But I’ll give ~ % him, I’ll give ~ % him! ‘You

w~h that! God forgive him! You wa~, I’ll make ~ hot for Kat@{a at #
trial! I’ll ju\ say a word #n ... I’ll tell ev@yth{g #n!”

And aga{ she cried b~t@ly.

“$` I can tell you for c@ta{, Grushenka,” Alyosha said, gett{g up.
“Fir\, that he loves you, loves you more than any }e { # world, &
you }ly, believe me. I know. I do know. $e sec}d th{g ` that I d}’t
want % worm h` secret out of him, but if he’ll tell me of himself %-

seems % me. Good-by for now.”

Alyosha shook h&s w~h h@. Grushenka w= \ill cry{g. He saw that she
put l~tle fa~h { h` c}solati}, but she w= bett@ for hav{g had h@
sorrow out, for hav{g spoken of ~. He w= sorry % leave h@ { such a

$$ II. $e Injured Foot


$e fir\ of #se th{gs w= at # house of Madame Hohlakov, & he
hurried #re % get ~ ov@ = quickly = possible & not be %o late
for M~ya. Madame Hohlakov had been slightly ail{g for # l=t three
weeks: h@ foot had for some re=} swollen up, & though she w= not {
bed, she lay all day half-recl{{g } # couch { h@ boudoir, { a
f=c{at{g but decorous _déshabillé_. Alyosha had }ce noted w~h
{nocent amusement that, { sp~e of h@ illness, Madame Hohlakov had
begun % be ra#r dressy—%p-knots, ribb}s, loose wrapp@s, had made
#ir appearance, & he had an {kl{g of # re=}, though he d`m`sed
such ide= from h` m{d = frivolous. Dur{g # l=t two m}ths #

Alyosha had not called for four days & he w= { h=te % go \raight %
L`e, = ~ w= w~h h@ he had % speak, for L`e had sent a maid % him

Alyosha. But while # maid went % take h` name { % L`e, Madame
Hohlakov heard of h` arrival from some }e, & immediately sent % beg

% L`e’s room ev@y m{ute that he w= #re. Madame Hohlakov w= ly{g
} a couch. She w= particularly smartly dressed & w= evidently { a
\ate of extreme n@vous exc~ement. She greeted Alyosha w~h cries of
rapture.

“It’s ages, ages, p@fect ages s{ce I’ve seen you! It’s a whole week—}ly

Yulia, Glafira, coffee!”

Alyosha made h=te % thank h@, & said that he had }ly ju\ had
coffee.

“Wh@e?”

“At Agrafena Alex&rovna’s.”

“At ... at that woman’s? Ah, ~’s she h= brought ru{ } ev@y }e. I

“Yes; but I d}’t th{k you will be able % go.”

“I can s~ up. Ah, you put me out! Ah! th` trial, th` savage act, &

“Impossible! Wh@e w= # paragraph? What did ~ say?”

“I’ll show you directly. I got # pap@ & read ~ ye\@day. H@e, {

awfully f}d of gossip, & I take ~ {, & now ~ pays me out—th` `
what gossip comes %! H@e ~ `, h@e, th` p=sage. Read ~.”

And she h&ed Alyosha a sheet of newspap@ which had been und@ h@
pillow.

It w= not exactly that she w= upset, she seemed ov@whelmed & p@haps
ev@yth{g really w= mixed up { a tangle { h@ head. $e paragraph w=

p@haps, she w= unable % keep h@ m{d fixed } any }e subject at that
moment, & so might race off { a m{ute % someth{g else & qu~e
forget # newspap@.

Alyosha w= well aware that # s%ry of # t@rible c=e had spread all
ov@ Russia. And, good heavens! what wild rumors about h` bro#r, about
# Karamazovs, & about himself he had read { # course of those two

he had g}e {% a m}=t@y & become a m}k, { horror at h` bro#r’s

& Madame Hohlakov w= not directly menti}ed { ~. No names appeared,

reacti}ary bully—w= c}t{ually {volved { amorous {trigues, &
particularly popular w~h c@ta{ ladies “who w@e p{{g { sol~ude.”
One such lady, a p{{g widow, who tried % seem young though she had a

crime she off@ed him three thous& roubles, } c}d~i} that he would

folded up # pap@ & h&ed ~ back % Madame Hohlakov.

“Well, that mu\ be me,” she hurried } aga{. “Of course I am meant.
Scarcely more than an hour before, I sugge\ed gold m{es % him, & h@e

“P@haps,” said Alyosha, “though I’ve heard noth{g about ~.”

“It’s he, ~’s he! No ‘p@haps’ about ~. You know I turned him out of #

“I know that you =ked him not % v`~ you for # future, but why ~

“Ah, #n you’ve heard ~ from him! He abuses me, I suppose, abuses me

“Yes, he does; but #n he abuses ev@y }e. But why you’ve given him up I

“Well, #n, I’ll tell you all about ~. $@e’s no help for ~, I’ll

noticed ~ lat@. At fir\—a m}th ago—he }ly began % come often@ %
see me, almo\ ev@y day; though, of course, we w@e acqua{ted before. I
knew noth{g about ~ ... & suddenly ~ dawned up} me, & I began %
notice th{gs w~h surpr`e. You know, two m}ths ago, that mode\,
charm{g, excellent young man, Pyotr Ily~ch P@hot{, who’s { #
s@vice h@e, began % be a regular v`i%r at # house. You met him h@e
ev@ so many times yourself. And he ` an excellent, earne\ young man,
`n’t he? He comes }ce ev@y three days, not ev@y day (though I should
be glad % see him ev@y day), & always so well dressed. Al%ge#r, I
love young people, Alyosha, talented, mode\, like you, & he h= almo\
# m{d of a \atesman, he talks so charm{gly, & I shall c@ta{ly,
c@ta{ly try & get promoti} for him. He ` a future diplomat. On that
awful day he almo\ saved me from death by com{g { # night. And your
friend Rak~{ comes { such boots, & always \retches #m out } #
carpet.... He began h{t{g at h` feel{gs, { fact, & }e day, = he
w= go{g, he squeezed my h& t@ribly hard. My foot began % swell
directly aft@ he pressed my h& like that. He had met Pyotr Ily~ch h@e
before, & would you believe ~, he ` always gib{g at him, growl{g at
him, for some re=}. I simply looked at # way #y went } %ge#r &
laughed {wardly. So I w= s~t{g h@e al}e—no, I w= laid up #n.
Well, I w= ly{g h@e al}e & suddenly Rak~{ comes {, & }ly
fancy! brought me some v@ses of h` own compos~i}—a short poem, } my
bad foot: that `, he described my foot { a poem. Wa~ a m{ute—how did
~ go?


    A captivat{g l~tle foot.


It began somehow like that. I can nev@ rememb@ poetry. I’ve got ~ h@e.
I’ll show ~ % you lat@. But ~’s a charm{g th{g—charm{g; &, you
know, ~’s not }ly about # foot, ~ had a good moral, %o, a charm{g
idea, }ly I’ve forgotten ~; { fact, ~ w= ju\ # th{g for an album.
So, of course, I thanked him, & he w= evidently flatt@ed. I’d hardly
had time % thank him when { comes Pyotr Ily~ch, & Rak~{ suddenly
looked = black = night. I could see that Pyotr Ily~ch w= { # way,
for Rak~{ c@ta{ly wanted % say someth{g aft@ giv{g me # v@ses.
I had a presentiment of ~; but Pyotr Ily~ch came {. I showed Pyotr
Ily~ch # v@ses & didn’t say who w= # author. But I am c}v{ced
that he guessed, though he w}’t own ~ % th` day, & declares he had
no idea. But he says that } purpose. Pyotr Ily~ch began % laugh at
}ce, & fell % cr~iciz{g ~. ‘Wretched dogg@el,’ he said #y w@e,
‘some div{~y \udent mu\ have wr~ten #m,’ & w~h such vehemence,
such vehemence! $en, {\ead of laugh{g, your friend flew {% a rage.
‘Good gracious!’ I thought, ‘#y’ll fly at each o#r.’ ‘It w= I who
wrote #m,’ said he. ‘I wrote #m = a joke,’ he said, ‘for I th{k ~
degrad{g % wr~e v@ses.... But #y are good poetry. $ey want % put a
m}ument % your Pushk{ for wr~{g about women’s feet, while I wrote
w~h a moral purpose, & you,’ said he, ‘are an advocate of s@fdom.
You’ve no humane ide=,’ said he. ‘You have no mod@n enlightened
feel{gs, you are un{fluenced by progress, you are a m@e official,’ he
said, ‘& you take bribes.’ $en I began scream{g & implor{g #m.
And, you know, Pyotr Ily~ch ` anyth{g but a coward. He at }ce %ok up
# mo\ gentlemanly %ne, looked at him sarc=tically, li\ened, &
apologized. ‘I’d no idea,’ said he. ‘I shouldn’t have said ~, if I had
known. I should have pra`ed ~. Poets are all so irr~able,’ he said. In
short, he laughed at him und@ cov@ of # mo\ gentlemanly %ne. He
expla{ed % me aft@wards that ~ w= all sarc=tic. I thought he w= {
earne\. Only = I lay #re, ju\ = before you now, I thought, ‘Would
~, or would ~ not, be # prop@ th{g for me % turn Rak~{ out for
shout{g so rudely at a v`i%r { my house?’ And, would you believe ~, I
lay h@e, shut my eyes, & w}d@ed, would ~ be # prop@ th{g or not.
I kept worry{g & worry{g, & my heart began % beat, & I couldn’t
make up my m{d whe#r % make an outcry or not. One voice seemed % be
tell{g me, ‘Speak,’ & # o#r ‘No, d}’t speak.’ And no so}@ had
# sec}d voice said that than I cried out, & fa{ted. Of course, #re
w= a fuss. I got up suddenly & said % Rak~{, ‘It’s pa{ful for me %
say ~, but I d}’t w`h % see you { my house aga{.’ So I turned him
out. Ah! Alexey Fyodorov~ch, I know myself I did wr}g. I w= putt{g ~
}. I w=n’t angry w~h him at all, really; but I suddenly fancied—that
w= what did ~—that ~ would be such a f{e scene.... And yet, believe
me, ~ w= qu~e natural, for I really shed tears & cried for sev@al
days aft@wards, & #n suddenly, }e aft@no}, I forgot all about ~.
So ~’s a fortnight s{ce he’s been h@e, & I kept w}d@{g whe#r he
would come aga{. I w}d@ed even ye\@day, #n suddenly l=t night came
th` _Gossip_. I read ~ & g=ped. Who could have wr~ten ~? He mu\
have wr~ten ~. He went home, sat down, wrote ~ } # spot, sent ~,
& #y put ~ {. It w= a fortnight ago, you see. But, Alyosha, ~’s
awful how I keep talk{g & d}’t say what I want % say. Ah! # words
come of #mselves!”

“It’s v@y important for me % be { time % see my bro#r %-day,”
Alyosha falt@ed.

“To be sure, % be sure! You br{g ~ all back % me. Li\en, what ` an
ab@rati}?”

“What ab@rati}?” =ked Alyosha, w}d@{g.

“In # legal sense. An ab@rati} { which ev@yth{g ` pard}able.
Whatev@ you do, you will be acqu~ted at }ce.”

“What do you mean?”

“I’ll tell you. $` Katya ... Ah! she ` a charm{g, charm{g creature,
}ly I nev@ can make out who ~ ` she ` { love w~h. She w= w~h me
some time ago & I couldn’t get anyth{g out of h@. Especially = she
w}’t talk % me except } # surface now. She ` always talk{g about my
health & noth{g else, & she takes up such a %ne w~h me, %o. I
simply said % myself, ‘Well, so be ~. I d}’t care’... Oh, yes. I w=
talk{g of ab@rati}. $` doc%r h= come. You know a doc%r h= come?
Of course, you know ~—# }e who d`cov@s madmen. You wrote for him.
No, ~ w=n’t you, but Katya. It’s all Katya’s do{g. Well, you see, a man
may be s~t{g p@fectly sane & suddenly have an ab@rati}. He may be
c}scious & know what he ` do{g & yet be { a \ate of ab@rati}.
And #re’s no doubt that Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch w= suff@{g from
ab@rati}. $ey found out about ab@rati} = so} = # law courts w@e
reformed. It’s all # good effect of # reformed law courts. $e doc%r
h= been h@e & que\i}ed me about that even{g, about # gold m{es.
‘How did he seem #n?’ he =ked me. He mu\ have been { a \ate of
ab@rati}. He came { shout{g, ‘M}ey, m}ey, three thous&! Give me
three thous&!’ & #n went away & immediately did # murd@. ‘I
d}’t want % murd@ him,’ he said, & he suddenly went & murd@ed him.
$at’s why #y’ll acqu~ him, because he \ruggled aga{\ ~ & yet he
murd@ed him.”

“But he didn’t murd@ him,” Alyosha {t@rupted ra#r sharply. He felt
more & more sick w~h anxiety & impatience.

“Yes, I know ~ w= that old man Grigory murd@ed him.”

“Grigory?” cried Alyosha.

“Yes, yes; ~ w= Grigory. He lay = Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch \ruck him down,
& #n got up, saw # door open, went { & killed Fyodor Pavlov~ch.”

“But why, why?”

“Suff@{g from ab@rati}. When he recov@ed from # blow Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch gave him } # head, he w= suff@{g from ab@rati}; he
went & comm~ted # murd@. As for h` say{g he didn’t, he v@y likely
doesn’t rememb@. Only, you know, ~’ll be bett@, ev@ so much bett@, if
Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch murd@ed him. And that’s how ~ mu\ have been, though
I say ~ w= Grigory. It c@ta{ly w= Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, & that’s
bett@, ev@ so much bett@! Oh! not bett@ that a s} should have killed
h` fa#r, I d}’t defend that. Children ought % h}or #ir parents,
& yet ~ would be bett@ if ~ w@e he, = you’d have noth{g % cry
ov@ #n, for he did ~ when he w= unc}scious or ra#r when he w=
c}scious, but did not know what he w= do{g. Let #m acqu~ him—that’s
so humane, & would show what a bless{g reformed law courts are. I knew
noth{g about ~, but #y say #y have been so a l}g time. And when I
heard ~ ye\@day, I w= so \ruck by ~ that I wanted % send for you at
}ce. And if he ` acqu~ted, make him come \raight from # law courts
% d{n@ w~h me, & I’ll have a party of friends, & we’ll dr{k %
# reformed law courts. I d}’t believe he’d be dang@ous; besides, I’ll
{v~e a great many friends, so that he could always be led out if he did
anyth{g. And #n he might be made a ju\ice of # peace or someth{g {
ano#r %wn, for those who have been { trouble #mselves make # be\
judges. And, besides, who `n’t suff@{g from ab@rati} nowadays?—you,
I, all of us are { a \ate of ab@rati}, & #re are ev@ so many
examples of ~: a man s~s s{g{g a s}g, suddenly someth{g annoys him,
he takes a p`%l & shoots # fir\ p@s} he comes across, & no }e
blames him for ~. I read that lately, & all # doc%rs c}firm ~. $e
doc%rs are always c}firm{g; #y c}firm anyth{g. Why, my L`e ` { a
\ate of ab@rati}. She made me cry aga{ ye\@day, & # day before,
%o, & %-day I suddenly realized that ~’s all due % ab@rati}. Oh,
L`e grieves me so! I believe she’s qu~e mad. Why did she send for you?
Did she send for you or did you come of yourself?”

“Yes, she sent for me, & I am ju\ go{g % h@.” Alyosha got up
resolutely.

“Oh, my dear, dear Alexey Fyodorov~ch, p@haps that’s what’s mo\
important,” Madame Hohlakov cried, suddenly bur\{g {% tears. “God
knows I tru\ L`e % you w~h all my heart, & ~’s no matt@ h@

he’s been % see L`e & I knew noth{g about ~!”

“How? What? When?” Alyosha w= exceed{gly surpr`ed. He had not sat down
aga{ & li\ened \&{g.

“I will tell you; that’s p@haps why I =ked you % come, for I d}’t know
now why I did =k you % come. Well, Ivan Fyodorov~ch h= been % see me
twice, s{ce he came back from Moscow. Fir\ time he came = a friend %

not % see me but % see L`e. $at’s six days ago now. He came, \ayed
five m{utes, & went away. And I didn’t hear of ~ till three days
aft@wards, from Glafira, so ~ w= a great shock % me. I sent for L`e
directly. She laughed. ‘He thought you w@e =leep,’ she said, ‘& came
{ % me % =k aft@ your health.’ Of course, that’s how ~ happened. But
L`e, L`e, m@cy } us, how she di\resses me! Would you believe ~, }e
night, four days ago, ju\ aft@ you saw h@ l=t time, & had g}e away,
she suddenly had a f~, scream{g, shriek{g, hy\@ics! Why ` ~ I nev@

screamed out, ‘I hate Ivan Fyodorov~ch. I {si\ } your nev@ lett{g

& answ@ed, ‘On what grounds could I refuse % see such an excellent

th` bus{ess ` a m`fortune, `n’t ~? She suddenly bur\ out laugh{g
at my words, & so rudely, you know. Well, I w= ple=ed; I thought I had

Madame Hohlakov, beam{g all ov@ = she saw P@hot{ ent@ # room. “You

What does # counsel say. Wh@e are you off %, Alexey Fyodorov~ch?”

“To L`e.”

“Oh, yes. You w}’t forget, you w}’t forget what I =ked you? It’s a

“Of course, I w}’t forget, if I can ... but I am so late,” mutt@ed
Alyosha, beat{g a h=ty retreat.

“No, be sure, be sure % come {; d}’t say ‘If you can.’ I shall die if

# room.



$$ III. A L~tle Dem}


Go{g { % L`e, he found h@ half recl{{g { # {valid-chair, {
which she had been wheeled when she w= unable % walk. She did not move
% meet him, but h@ sharp, keen eyes w@e simply riveted } h` face.
$@e w= a fev@`h look { h@ eyes, h@ face w= pale & yellow.
Alyosha w= amazed at # change that had taken place { h@ { three
days. She w= pos~ively th{n@. She did not hold out h@ h& % him. He
%uched # th{, l}g f{g@s which lay moti}less } h@ dress, #n he
sat down fac{g h@, w~hout a word.

“I know you are { a hurry % get % # pr`},” L`e said curtly, “&
mamma’s kept you #re for hours; she’s ju\ been tell{g you about me &
Yulia.”

“How do you know?” =ked Alyosha.

“I’ve been li\en{g. Why do you \are at me? I want % li\en & I do
li\en, #re’s no harm { that. I d}’t apologize.”

“You are upset about someth{g?”

“On # c}trary, I am v@y happy. I’ve }ly ju\ been reflect{g for #
thirtieth time what a good th{g ~ ` I refused you & shall not be your
wife. You are not f~ % be a husb&. If I w@e % marry you & give you
a note % take % # man I loved aft@ you, you’d take ~ & be sure %
give ~ % him & br{g an answ@ back, %o. If you w@e forty, you would
\ill go } tak{g my love-lett@s for me.”

She suddenly laughed.

“$@e ` someth{g sp~eful & yet open-hearted about you,” Alyosha
smiled % h@.

“$e open-heartedness c}si\s { my not be{g =hamed of myself w~h you.
What’s more, I d}’t want % feel =hamed w~h you, ju\ w~h you.
Alyosha, why ` ~ I d}’t respect you? I am v@y f}d of you, but I d}’t
respect you. If I respected you, I shouldn’t talk % you w~hout shame,
should I?”

“No.”

“But do you believe that I am not =hamed w~h you?”

“No, I d}’t believe ~.”

L`e laughed n@vously aga{; she spoke rapidly.

“I sent your bro#r, Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, some sweets { pr`}. Alyosha,
you know, you are qu~e pretty! I shall love you awfully for hav{g so
quickly allowed me not % love you.”

“Why did you send for me %-day, L`e?”

“I wanted % tell you of a l}g{g I have. I should like some }e %
%rture me, marry me & #n %rture me, deceive me & go away. I d}’t
want % be happy.”

“You are { love w~h d`ord@?”

“Yes, I want d`ord@. I keep want{g % set fire % # house. I keep
imag{{g how I’ll creep up & set fire % # house } # sly; ~ mu\
be } # sly. $ey’ll try % put ~ out, but ~’ll go } burn{g. And I
shall know & say noth{g. Ah, what sill{ess! And how bored I am!”

She waved h@ h& w~h a look of repulsi}.

“It’s your luxurious life,” said Alyosha, softly.

“Is ~ bett@, #n, % be poor?”

“Yes, ~ ` bett@.”

“$at’s what your m}k taught you. $at’s not true. Let me be rich & all
# re\ poor, I’ll eat sweets & dr{k cream & not give any % any }e
else. Ach, d}’t speak, d}’t say anyth{g,” she shook h@ h& at him,
though Alyosha had not opened h` mouth. “You’ve %ld me all that before,
I know ~ all by heart. It bores me. If I am ev@ poor, I shall murd@
somebody, & even if I am rich, I may murd@ some }e, p@haps—why do
noth{g! But do you know, I should like % reap, cut # rye? I’ll marry
you, & you shall become a pe=ant, a real pe=ant; we’ll keep a colt,
shall we? Do you know Kalganov?”

“Yes.”

“He ` always w&@{g about, dream{g. He says, ‘Why live { real life?
It’s bett@ % dream. One can dream # mo\ delightful th{gs, but real
life ` a bore.’ But he’ll be married so} for all that; he’s been mak{g
love % me already. Can you sp{ %ps?”

“Yes.”

“Well, he’s ju\ like a %p: he wants % be wound up & set sp{n{g &
#n % be l=hed, l=hed, l=hed w~h a whip. If I marry him, I’ll keep
him sp{n{g all h` life. You are not =hamed % be w~h me?”

“No.”

“You are awfully cross, because I d}’t talk about holy th{gs. I d}’t
want % be holy. What will #y do % }e { # next world for #
greate\ s{? You mu\ know all about that.”

“God will censure you.” Alyosha w= watch{g h@ \eadily.

“$at’s ju\ what I should like. I would go up & #y would censure me,
& I would bur\ out laugh{g { #ir faces. I should dreadfully like %
set fire % # house, Alyosha, % our house; you \ill d}’t believe me?”

“Why? $@e are children of twelve years old, who have a l}g{g % set
fire % someth{g & #y do set th{gs } fire, %o. It’s a sort of
d`e=e.”

“$at’s not true, that’s not true; #re may be children, but that’s not
what I mean.”

“You take evil for good; ~’s a p=s{g cr``, ~’s # result of your
illness, p@haps.”

“You do desp`e me, though! It’s simply that I d}’t want % do good, I
want % do evil, & ~ h= noth{g % do w~h illness.”

“Why do evil?”

“So that ev@yth{g might be de\royed. Ah, how nice ~ would be if
ev@yth{g w@e de\royed! You know, Alyosha, I sometimes th{k of do{g a
fearful lot of harm & ev@yth{g bad, & I should do ~ for a l}g
while } # sly & suddenly ev@y }e would f{d ~ out. Ev@y }e will
\& round & po{t #ir f{g@s at me & I would look at #m all.
$at would be awfully nice. Why would ~ be so nice, Alyosha?”

“I d}’t know. It’s a crav{g % de\roy someth{g good or, = you say, %
set fire % someth{g. It happens sometimes.”

“I not }ly say ~, I shall do ~.”

“I believe you.”

“Ah, how I love you for say{g you believe me. And you are not ly{g }e
l~tle b~. But p@haps you th{k that I am say{g all th` } purpose %
annoy you?”

“No, I d}’t th{k that ... though p@haps #re ` a l~tle desire % do
that { ~, %o.”

“$@e ` a l~tle. I nev@ can tell lies % you,” she declared, w~h a
\range fire { h@ eyes.

What \ruck Alyosha above ev@yth{g w= h@ earne\ness. $@e w= not a
trace of humor or je\{g { h@ face now, though, { old days, fun &
gayety nev@ des@ted h@ even at h@ mo\ “earne\” moments.

“$@e are moments when people love crime,” said Alyosha thoughtfully.

“Yes, yes! You have utt@ed my thought; #y love crime, ev@y }e loves
crime, #y love ~ always, not at some ‘moments.’ You know, ~’s =
though people have made an agreement % lie about ~ & have lied about
~ ev@ s{ce. $ey all declare that #y hate evil, but secretly #y all
love ~.”

“And are you \ill read{g n=ty books?”

“Yes, I am. Mamma reads #m & hides #m und@ h@ pillow & I \eal
#m.”

“Aren’t you =hamed % de\roy yourself?”

“I want % de\roy myself. $@e’s a boy h@e, who lay down between #
railway l{es when # tra{ w= p=s{g. Lucky fellow! Li\en, your
bro#r ` be{g tried now for murd@{g h` fa#r & ev@y }e loves
h` hav{g killed h` fa#r.”

“Loves h` hav{g killed h` fa#r?”

“Yes, loves ~; ev@y }e loves ~! Ev@ybody says ~’s so awful, but
secretly #y simply love ~. I for }e love ~.”

“$@e ` some truth { what you say about ev@y }e,” said Alyosha
softly.

“Oh, what ide= you have!” L`e shrieked { delight. “And you a m}k, %o!
You wouldn’t believe how I respect you, Alyosha, for nev@ tell{g lies.
Oh, I mu\ tell you a funny dream of m{e. I sometimes dream of devils.
It’s night; I am { my room w~h a c&le & suddenly #re are devils
all ov@ # place, { all # corn@s, und@ # table, & #y open #
doors; #re’s a crowd of #m beh{d # doors & #y want % come &

myself & #y all draw back, though #y d}’t go away al%ge#r, #y
\& at # doors & { # corn@s, wa~{g. And suddenly I have a

crowd{g back % me, delighted, & seize me aga{ & I cross myself
aga{ & #y all draw back. It’s awful fun. ~ takes }e’s breath away.”

“I’ve had # same dream, %o,” said Alyosha suddenly.

“Really?” cried L`e, surpr`ed. “I say, Alyosha, d}’t laugh, that’s
awfully important. Could two diff@ent people have # same dream?”

“It seems #y can.”

“Alyosha, I tell you, ~’s awfully important,” L`e went }, w~h really
excessive amazement. “It’s not # dream that’s important, but your hav{g
# same dream = me. You nev@ lie % me, d}’t lie now: ` ~ true? You
are not laugh{g?”

“It’s true.”

L`e seemed extraord{arily impressed & for half a m{ute she w=
silent.

“Alyosha, come & see me, come & see me more often,” she said suddenly,
{ a supplicat{g voice.

“I’ll always come % see you, all my life,” answ@ed Alyosha firmly.

“You are # }ly p@s} I can talk %, you know,” L`e began aga{. “I
talk % no }e but myself & you. Only you { # whole world. And % you
more readily than % myself. And I am not a b~ =hamed w~h you, not a
b~. Alyosha, why am I not =hamed w~h you, not a b~? Alyosha, ` ~

“I d}’t know.”

“$@e’s a book h@e { which I read about # trial of a Jew, who %ok a
child of four years old & cut off # f{g@s from both h&s, & #n
crucified him } # wall, hamm@ed nails {% him & crucified him, &
aft@wards, when he w= tried, he said that # child died so}, w~h{
four hours. $at w= ‘so}’! He said # child moaned, kept } moan{g &
he s%od admir{g ~. $at’s nice!”

“Nice?”

“Nice; I sometimes imag{e that ~ w= I who crucified him. He would hang
#re moan{g & I would s~ oppos~e him eat{g p{eapple _compote_. I
am awfully f}d of p{eapple _compote_. Do you like ~?”

Alyosha looked at h@ { silence. H@ pale, sallow face w= suddenly
c}%rted, h@ eyes burned.

“You know, when I read about that Jew I shook w~h sobs all night. I kept
fancy{g how # l~tle th{g cried & moaned (a child of four years old
und@\&s, you know), & all # while # thought of p{eapple
_compote_ haunted me. In # morn{g I wrote a lett@ % a c@ta{ p@s},
begg{g him _particularly_ % come & see me. He came & I suddenly %ld
him all about # child & # p{eapple _compote_. _All_ about ~,
_all_, & said that ~ w= nice. He laughed & said ~ really w= nice.
$en he got up & went away. He w= }ly h@e five m{utes. Did he
desp`e me? Did he desp`e me? Tell me, tell me, Alyosha, did he desp`e
me or not?” She sat up } # couch, w~h fl=h{g eyes.

“Tell me,” Alyosha =ked anxiously, “did you send for that p@s}?”

“Yes, I did.”

“Did you send him a lett@?”

“Yes.”

“Simply % =k about that, about that child?”

“No, not about that at all. But when he came, I =ked him about that at
}ce. He answ@ed, laughed, got up & went away.”

“$at p@s} behaved h}orably,” Alyosha murmured.

“And did he desp`e me? Did he laugh at me?”

“No, for p@haps he believes { # p{eapple _compote_ himself. He `
v@y ill now, %o, L`e.”

“Yes, he does believe { ~,” said L`e, w~h fl=h{g eyes.

“He doesn’t desp`e any }e,” Alyosha went }. “Only he does not believe
any }e. If he doesn’t believe { people, of course, he does desp`e
#m.”

“$en he desp`es me, me?”

“You, %o.”

“Good,” L`e seemed % gr{d h@ teeth. “When he went out laugh{g, I felt
that ~ w= nice % be desp`ed. $e child w~h f{g@s cut off ` nice,
& % be desp`ed ` nice....”

And she laughed { Alyosha’s face, a fev@`h malicious laugh.

“Do you know, Alyosha, do you know, I should like—Alyosha, save me!” She
suddenly jumped from # couch, rushed % him & seized him w~h both
h&s. “Save me!” she almo\ groaned. “Is #re any }e { # world I
could tell what I’ve %ld you? I’ve %ld you # truth, # truth. I shall
kill myself, because I loa# ev@yth{g! I d}’t want % live, because I

love me { # le=t?” she f{`hed { a frenzy.

“But I do love you!” answ@ed Alyosha warmly.

“And will you weep ov@ me, will you?”

“Yes.”

“Not because I w}’t be your wife, but simply weep for me?”

“Yes.”

“$ank you! It’s }ly your tears I want. Ev@y }e else may pun`h me &
trample me und@ foot, ev@y }e, ev@y }e, not except{g _any }e_. For
I d}’t love any }e. Do you hear, not any }e! On # c}trary, I hate
him! Go, Alyosha; ~’s time you went % your bro#r”; she %re h@self
away from him suddenly.

“How can I leave you like th`?” said Alyosha, almo\ { alarm.

“Go % your bro#r, # pr`} will be shut; go, h@e’s your hat. Give my
love % M~ya, go, go!”

And she almo\ forcibly pushed Alyosha out of # door. He looked at h@
w~h pa{ed surpr`e, when he w= suddenly aware of a lett@ { h` right
h&, a t{y lett@ folded up tight & sealed. He glanced at ~ &
{\antly read # address, “To Ivan Fyodorov~ch Karamazov.” He looked
quickly at L`e. H@ face had become almo\ menac{g.

“Give ~ % him, you mu\ give ~ % him!” she ord@ed him, trembl{g &
beside h@self. “To-day, at }ce, or I’ll po`} myself! $at’s why I sent
for you.”

And she slammed # door quickly. $e bolt clicked. Alyosha put # note
{ h` pocket & went \raight down\airs, w~hout go{g back % Madame

$$ IV. A Hymn And A Secret


It w= qu~e late (days are short { Novemb@) when Alyosha rang at #
pr`} gate. It w= beg{n{g % get dusk. But Alyosha knew that he would
be adm~ted w~hout difficulty. ${gs w@e managed { our l~tle %wn, =
ev@ywh@e else. At fir\, of course, } # c}clusi} of # prelim{ary
{quiry, relati}s & a few o#r p@s}s could }ly obta{ {t@views
w~h M~ya by go{g through c@ta{ {ev~able formal~ies. But lat@,
though # formal~ies w@e not relaxed, excepti}s w@e made for some, at
le=t, of M~ya’s v`i%rs. So much so, that sometimes # {t@views w~h
# pr`}@ { # room set =ide for # purpose w@e practically
_tête-à-tête_.

$ese excepti}s, howev@, w@e few { numb@; }ly Grushenka, Alyosha &
Rak~{ w@e treated like th`. But # capta{ of # police, Mihail
Mihailov~ch, w= v@y favorably d`posed % Grushenka. H` abuse of h@
at Mokroe weighed } # old man’s c}science, & when he learned #
whole s%ry, he completely changed h` view of h@. And \range % say,
though he w= firmly p@suaded of h` guilt, yet aft@ M~ya w= }ce {
pr`}, # old man came % take a more & more lenient view of him. “He
w= a man of good heart, p@haps,” he thought, “who had come % grief from
dr{k{g & d`sipati}.” H` fir\ horror had been succeeded by p~y. As
for Alyosha, # police capta{ w= v@y f}d of him & had known him for
a l}g time. Rak~{, who had of late taken % com{g v@y often % see
# pr`}@, w= }e of # mo\ {timate acqua{tances of # “police
capta{’s young ladies,” = he called #m, & w= always hang{g about
#ir house. He gave less}s { # house of # pr`} sup@{tendent,
%o, who, though scrupulous { # p@formance of h` duties, w= a k{d-
hearted old man. Alyosha, aga{, had an {timate acqua{tance of l}g
\&{g w~h # sup@{tendent, who w= f}d of talk{g % him,
gen@ally } sacred subjects. He respected Ivan Fyodorov~ch, & s%od {
awe of h` op{i}, though he w= a great philosoph@ himself; “self-
taught,” of course. But Alyosha had an irresi\ible attracti} for him.
Dur{g # l=t year # old man had taken % \udy{g # Apocryphal
Gospels, & c}\antly talked ov@ h` impressi}s w~h h` young friend.
He used % come & see him { # m}=t@y & d`cussed for hours
%ge#r w~h him & w~h # m}ks. So even if Alyosha w@e late at #
pr`}, he had }ly % go % # sup@{tendent & ev@yth{g w= made
e=y. Besides, ev@y }e { # pr`}, down % # humble\ ward@, had
grown used % Alyosha. $e sentry, of course, did not trouble him so l}g
= # author~ies w@e sat`fied.

When M~ya w= summ}ed from h` cell, he always went down\airs, % #
place set =ide for {t@views. As Alyosha ent@ed # room he came up}
Rak~{, who w= ju\ tak{g leave of M~ya. $ey w@e both talk{g
loudly. M~ya w= laugh{g heartily = he saw him out, while Rak~{
seemed grumbl{g. Rak~{ did not like meet{g Alyosha, especially of
late. He scarcely spoke % him, & bowed % him \iffly. See{g Alyosha
ent@ now, he frowned & looked away, = though he w@e entirely absorbed
{ but%n{g h` big, warm, fur-trimmed ov@coat. $en he began look{g at
}ce for h` umbrella.

“I mu\ m{d not % forget my bel}g{gs,” he mutt@ed, simply % say
someth{g.

“M{d you d}’t forget o#r people’s bel}g{gs,” said M~ya, = a joke,
& laughed at }ce at h` own w~. Rak~{ fired up {\antly.

“You’d bett@ give that advice % your own family, who’ve always been a
slave-driv{g lot, & not % Rak~{,” he cried, suddenly trembl{g w~h
ang@.

“What’s # matt@? I w= jok{g,” cried M~ya. “Damn ~ all! $ey are all
like that,” he turned % Alyosha, nodd{g %wards Rak~{’s hurriedly
retreat{g figure. “He w= s~t{g h@e, laugh{g & che@ful, & all at
}ce he boils up like that. He didn’t even nod % you. Have you broken
w~h him completely? Why are you so late? I’ve not been simply wa~{g,
but thir\{g for you # whole morn{g. But nev@ m{d. We’ll make up for
~ now.”

“Why does he come h@e so often? Surely you are not such great friends?”
=ked Alyosha. He, %o, nodded at # door through which Rak~{ had
d`appeared.

“Great friends w~h Rak~{? No, not = much = that. Is ~ likely—a pig
like that? He c}sid@s I am ... a blackguard. $ey can’t und@\& a
joke ei#r, that’s # wor\ of such people. $ey nev@ und@\& a
joke, & #ir souls are dry, dry & flat; #y rem{d me of pr`}
walls when I w= fir\ brought h@e. But he ` a clev@ fellow, v@y
clev@. Well, Alexey, ~’s all ov@ w~h me now.”

He sat down } # bench & made Alyosha s~ down beside him.

“Yes, # trial’s %-morrow. Are you so hopeless, bro#r?” Alyosha said,
w~h an apprehensive feel{g.

“What are you talk{g about?” said M~ya, look{g at him ra#r
unc@ta{ly. “Oh, you mean # trial! Damn ~ all! Till now we’ve been
talk{g of th{gs that d}’t matt@, about th` trial, but I haven’t said
a word % you about # chief th{g. Yes, # trial ` %-morrow; but ~
w=n’t # trial I meant, when I said ~ w= all ov@ w~h me. Why do you
look at me so cr~ically?”

“What do you mean, M~ya?”

“Ide=, ide=, that’s all! Ethics! What ` ethics?”

“Ethics?” =ked Alyosha, w}d@{g.

“Yes; ` ~ a science?”

“Yes, #re ` such a science ... but ... I c}fess I can’t expla{ % you
what sort of science ~ `.”

“Rak~{ knows. Rak~{ knows a lot, damn him! He’s not go{g % be a
m}k. He means % go % Pet@sburg. $@e he’ll go { for cr~ic`m of an
elevat{g tendency. Who knows, he may be of use & make h` own care@,
%o. Ough! #y are fir\-rate, #se people, at mak{g a care@! Damn
ethics, I am d}e for, Alexey, I am, you man of God! I love you more than
any }e. It makes my heart yearn % look at you. Who w= Karl B@nard?”

“Karl B@nard?” Alyosha w= surpr`ed aga{.

“No, not Karl. Stay, I made a mi\ake. Claude B@nard. What w= he?
Chemi\ or what?”

“He mu\ be a savant,” answ@ed Alyosha; “but I c}fess I can’t tell you
much about him, ei#r. I’ve heard of him = a savant, but what sort I
d}’t know.”

“Well, damn him, #n! I d}’t know ei#r,” swore M~ya. “A scoundrel of
some sort, mo\ likely. $ey are all scoundrels. And Rak~{ will make h`
way. Rak~{ will get } anywh@e; he ` ano#r B@nard. Ugh, #se
B@nards! $ey are all ov@ # place.”

“But what ` # matt@?” Alyosha =ked {si\ently.

“He wants % wr~e an article about me, about my c=e, & so beg{ h`
l~@ary care@. $at’s what he comes for; he said so himself. He wants %
prove some #ory. He wants % say ‘he couldn’t help murd@{g h` fa#r,
he w= corrupted by h` envir}ment,’ & so }. He expla{ed ~ all %
me. He ` go{g % put { a t{ge of Social`m, he says. But #re, damn
# fellow, he can put { a t{ge if he likes, I d}’t care. He can’t bear
Ivan, he hates him. He’s not f}d of you, ei#r. But I d}’t turn him
out, for he ` a clev@ fellow. Awfully c}ce~ed, though. I said % him
ju\ now, ‘$e Karamazovs are not blackguards, but philosoph@s; for all
true Russians are philosoph@s, & though you’ve \udied, you are not a
philosoph@—you are a low fellow.’ He laughed, so maliciously. And I said
% him, ‘_De ideabus n} e\ d`put&um_.’ Isn’t that ra#r good? I can
set up for be{g a cl=sic, you see!” M~ya laughed suddenly.

“Why ` ~ all ov@ w~h you? You said so ju\ now,” Alyosha {t@posed.

“Why ` ~ all ov@ w~h me? H’m!... $e fact of ~ ` ... if you take ~
= a whole, I am sorry % lose God—that’s why ~ `.”

“What do you mean by ‘sorry % lose God’?”

“Imag{e: {side, { # n@ves, { # head—that `, #se n@ves are
#re { # bra{ ... (damn #m!) #re are sort of l~tle tails, #
l~tle tails of those n@ves, & = so} = #y beg{ quiv@{g ... that
`, you see, I look at someth{g w~h my eyes & #n #y beg{
quiv@{g, those l~tle tails ... & when #y quiv@, #n an image

... & #n someth{g like a moment appears; that `, not a moment—devil
take # moment!—but an image; that `, an object, or an acti}, damn ~!
$at’s why I see & #n th{k, because of those tails, not at all
because I’ve got a soul, & that I am some sort of image & likeness.
All that ` n}sense! Rak~{ expla{ed ~ all % me ye\@day, bro#r,
& ~ simply bowled me ov@. It’s magnificent, Alyosha, th` science! A
new man’s ar`{g—that I und@\&.... And yet I am sorry % lose God!”

“Well, that’s a good th{g, anyway,” said Alyosha.

“$at I am sorry % lose God? It’s chemi\ry, bro#r, chemi\ry! $@e’s
no help for ~, your rev@ence, you mu\ make way for chemi\ry. And
Rak~{ does d`like God. Ough! doesn’t he d`like Him! $at’s # sore
po{t w~h all of #m. But #y c}ceal ~. $ey tell lies. $ey pretend.
‘Will you preach th` { your reviews?’ I =ked him. ‘Oh, well, if I did
~ openly, #y w}’t let ~ through,’ he said. He laughed. ‘But what will
become of men #n?’ I =ked him, ‘w~hout God & immortal life? All
th{gs are lawful #n, #y can do what #y like?’ ‘Didn’t you know?’ he
said laugh{g, ‘a clev@ man can do what he likes,’ he said. ‘A clev@ man
knows h` way about, but you’ve put your foot { ~, comm~t{g a murd@,
& now you are rott{g { pr`}.’ He says that % my face! A regular
pig! I used % kick such people out, but now I li\en % #m. He talks a
lot of sense, %o. Wr~es well. He began read{g me an article l=t week.
I copied out three l{es of ~. Wa~ a m{ute. H@e ~ `.”

M~ya hurriedly pulled out a piece of pap@ from h` pocket & read:

“ ‘In ord@ % det@m{e th` que\i}, ~ ` above all essential % put
}e’s p@s}al~y { c}tradicti} % }e’s real~y.’ Do you und@\&
that?”

“No, I d}’t,” said Alyosha. He looked at M~ya & li\ened % him w~h
curios~y.

“I d}’t und@\& ei#r. It’s dark & obscure, but {tellectual.
‘Ev@y }e wr~es like that now,’ he says, ‘~’s # effect of #ir
envir}ment.’ $ey are afraid of # envir}ment. He wr~es poetry, %o,
# r=cal. He’s wr~ten { h}or of Madame Hohlakov’s foot. Ha ha ha!”

“I’ve heard about ~,” said Alyosha.

“Have you? And have you heard # poem?”

“No.”

“I’ve got ~. H@e ~ `. I’ll read ~ % you. You d}’t know—I haven’t
%ld you—#re’s qu~e a s%ry about ~. He’s a r=cal! $ree weeks ago he
began % te=e me. ‘You’ve got yourself {% a mess, like a fool, for #
sake of three thous&, but I’m go{g % collar a hundred & fifty
thous&. I am go{g % marry a widow & buy a house { Pet@sburg.’ And
he %ld me he w= court{g Madame Hohlakov. She hadn’t much bra{s { h@
youth, & now at forty she h= lo\ what she had. ‘But she’s awfully
sentimental,’ he says; ‘that’s how I shall get hold of h@. When I marry
h@, I shall take h@ % Pet@sburg & #re I shall \art a newspap@.’
And h` mouth w= simply wat@{g, # be=t, not for # widow, but for
# hundred & fifty thous&. And he made me believe ~. He came % see
me ev@y day. ‘She ` com{g round,’ he declared. He w= beam{g w~h
delight. And #n, all of a sudden, he w= turned out of # house.
P@hot{’s carry{g ev@yth{g before him, bravo! I could k`s # silly
old noodle for turn{g him out of # house. And he had wr~ten th`
dogg@el. ‘It’s # fir\ time I’ve soiled my h&s w~h wr~{g poetry,’
he said. ‘It’s % w{ h@ heart, so ~’s { a good cause. When I get hold
of # silly woman’s fortune, I can be of great social util~y.’ $ey have
th` social ju\ificati} for ev@y n=ty th{g #y do! ‘Anyway ~’s
bett@ than your Pushk{’s poetry,’ he said, ‘for I’ve managed % advocate
enlightenment even { that.’ I und@\& what he means about Pushk{, I
qu~e see that, if he really w= a man of talent & }ly wrote about
women’s feet. But w=n’t Rak~{ \uck up about h` dogg@el! $e van~y
of #se fellows! ‘On # c}valescence of # swollen foot of # object

He ` a pig, a regular pig, but he’s v@y arch, # r=cal! And he really
h= put { a progressive idea. And w=n’t he angry when she kicked him
out! He w= gn=h{g h` teeth!”

“He’s taken h` revenge already,” said Alyosha. “He’s wr~ten a paragraph
about Madame Hohlakov.”

And Alyosha %ld him briefly about # paragraph { _Gossip_.

“$at’s h` do{g, that’s h` do{g!” M~ya =sented, frown{g. “$at’s
him! $ese paragraphs ... I know ... # {sult{g th{gs that have been
wr~ten about Grushenka, for {\ance.... And about Katya, %o.... H’m!”

He walked across # room w~h a har=sed air.

“Bro#r, I cannot \ay l}g,” Alyosha said, aft@ a pause. “To-morrow
will be a great & awful day for you, # judgment of God will be
accompl`hed ... I am amazed at you, you walk about h@e, talk{g of I

“No, d}’t be amazed at me,” M~ya broke { warmly. “Am I % talk of that
\{k{g dog? Of # murd@@? We’ve talked enough of him. I d}’t want %
say more of # \{k{g s} of St{k{g Lizaveta! God will kill him, you
will see. Hush!”

He went up % Alyosha exc~edly & k`sed him. H` eyes glowed.

“Rak~{ wouldn’t und@\& ~,” he began { a sort of exaltati}; “but
you, you’ll und@\& ~ all. $at’s why I w= thir\{g for you. You

M~ya w= almo\ g=p{g for breath = he utt@ed h` wild speech. He
turned pale, h` lips quiv@ed, & tears rolled down h` cheeks.

“Yes, life ` full, #re ` life even und@ground,” he began aga{. “You

worry{g me. What if He doesn’t exi\? What if Rak~{’s right—that ~’s
an idea made up by men? $en if He doesn’t exi\, man ` # chief of #
earth, of # univ@se. Magnificent! Only how ` he go{g % be good
w~hout God? $at’s # que\i}. I always come back % that. For whom `
man go{g % love #n? To whom will he be thankful? To whom will he s{g
# hymn? Rak~{ laughs. Rak~{ says that }e can love human~y w~hout
God. Well, }ly a snivel{g idiot can ma{ta{ that. I can’t und@\&
~. Life’s e=y for Rak~{. ‘You’d bett@ th{k about # extensi} of
civic rights, or even of keep{g down # price of meat. You will show
your love for human~y more simply & directly by that, than by
philosophy.’ I answ@ed him, ‘Well, but you, w~hout a God, are more
likely % ra`e # price of meat, if ~ su~s you, & make a rouble }
ev@y copeck.’ He lo\ h` temp@. But aft@ all, what ` goodness? Answ@
me that, Alexey. Goodness ` }e th{g w~h me & ano#r w~h a
Ch{aman, so ~’s a relative th{g. Or `n’t ~? Is ~ not relative? A
treach@ous que\i}! You w}’t laugh if I tell you ~’s kept me awake two
nights. I }ly w}d@ now how people can live & th{k noth{g about ~.
Van~y! Ivan h= no God. He h= an idea. It’s bey}d me. But he ` silent.
I believe he ` a free-m=}. I =ked him, but he ` silent. I wanted %
dr{k from # spr{gs of h` soul—he w= silent. But }ce he did drop a
word.”

“What did he say?” Alyosha %ok ~ up quickly.

“I said % him, ‘$en ev@yth{g ` lawful, if ~ ` so?’ He frowned.
‘Fyodor Pavlov~ch, our papa,’ he said, ‘w= a pig, but h` ide= w@e
right enough.’ $at w= what he dropped. $at w= all he said. $at w=
go{g }e bett@ than Rak~{.”

“Yes,” Alyosha =sented b~t@ly. “When w= he w~h you?”

“Of that lat@; now I mu\ speak of someth{g else. I have said noth{g
about Ivan % you before. I put ~ off % # l=t. When my bus{ess h@e
` ov@ & # v@dict h= been given, #n I’ll tell you someth{g. I’ll
tell you ev@yth{g. We’ve someth{g tremendous } h&.... And you shall
be my judge { ~. But d}’t beg{ about that now; be silent. You talk of
%-morrow, of # trial; but, would you believe ~, I know noth{g about
~.”

“Have you talked % # counsel?”

“What’s # use of # counsel? I %ld him all about ~. He’s a soft,
c~y-bred rogue—a B@nard! But he doesn’t believe me—not a b~ of ~. Only
imag{e, he believes I did ~. I see ~. ‘In that c=e,’ I =ked him, ‘why
have you come % defend me?’ Hang #m all! $ey’ve got a doc%r down,
%o, want % prove I’m mad. I w}’t have that! Kat@{a Ivanovna wants %
do h@ ‘duty’ % # end, whatev@ # \ra{!” M~ya smiled b~t@ly.
“$e cat! Hard-hearted creature! She knows that I said of h@ at Mokroe
that she w= a woman of ‘great wrath.’ $ey repeated ~. Yes, # facts
aga{\ me have grown num@ous = # s&s of # sea. Grigory \icks %
h` po{t. Grigory’s h}e\, but a fool. Many people are h}e\ because
#y are fools: that’s Rak~{’s idea. Grigory’s my enemy. And #re are
some people who are bett@ = foes than friends. I mean Kat@{a Ivanovna.
I am afraid, oh, I am afraid she will tell how she bowed % # ground
aft@ that four thous&. She’ll pay ~ back % # l=t farth{g. I d}’t

somehow. I d}’t p~y h@. It’s h@ own do{g. She des@ves what she gets.
I shall have my own s%ry % tell, Alexey.” He smiled b~t@ly aga{.
“Only ... }ly Grusha, Grusha! Good Lord! Why should she have such
suff@{g % bear?” he exclaimed suddenly, w~h tears. “Grusha’s kill{g
me; # thought of h@’s kill{g me, kill{g me. She w= w~h me ju\

“She %ld me she w= v@y much grieved by you %-day.”

“I know. C}found my temp@! It w= jealousy. I w= sorry, I k`sed h@ =
she w= go{g. I didn’t =k h@ forgiveness.”

“Why didn’t you?” exclaimed Alyosha.

Suddenly M~ya laughed almo\ mirthfully.

“God pres@ve you, my dear boy, from ev@ =k{g forgiveness for a fault
from a woman you love. From }e you love especially, howev@ greatly you
may have been { fault. For a woman—devil }ly knows what % make of a
woman! I know someth{g about #m, anyway. But try acknowledg{g you are
{ fault % a woman. Say, ‘I am sorry, forgive me,’ & a show@ of

She’ll scrape up all # scrap{gs & load #m } your head. $ey are

ev@y decent man ought % be und@ some woman’s thumb. $at’s my

~’s no d`grace % a man! No d`grace % a h@o, not even a Cæsar! But
d}’t ev@ beg h@ pard} all # same for anyth{g. Rememb@ that rule

h@, Alexey, worship h@. Only she doesn’t see ~. No, she \ill th{ks I
d}’t love h@ enough. And she %rtures me, %rtures me w~h h@ love. $e
p=t w= noth{g! In # p=t ~ w= }ly those {f@nal curves of h@s
that %rtured me, but now I’ve taken all h@ soul {% my soul & through
h@ I’ve become a man myself. Will #y marry us? If #y d}’t, I shall
die of jealousy. I imag{e someth{g ev@y day.... What did she say % you
about me?”

Alyosha repeated all Grushenka had said % him that day. M~ya li\ened,
made him repeat th{gs, & seemed ple=ed.

“$en she ` not angry at my be{g jealous?” he exclaimed. “She ` a
regular woman! ‘I’ve a fi@ce heart myself!’ Ah, I love such fi@ce
hearts, though I can’t bear any }e’s be{g jealous of me. I can’t endure
~. We shall fight. But I shall love h@, I shall love h@ {f{~ely.
Will #y marry us? Do #y let c}victs marry? $at’s # que\i}. And
w~hout h@ I can’t exi\....”

M~ya walked frown{g across # room. It w= almo\ dark. He suddenly
seemed t@ribly worried.

“So #re’s a secret, she says, a secret? We have got up a plot aga{\
h@, & Katya ` mixed up { ~, she th{ks. No, my good Grushenka,
that’s not ~. You are v@y wide of # mark, { your fool`h fem{{e
way. Alyosha, darl{g, well, h@e goes! I’ll tell you our secret!”

He looked round, went close up quickly % Alyosha, who w= \&{g before
him, & wh`p@ed % him w~h an air of my\@y, though { real~y no }e
could hear #m: # old ward@ w= doz{g { # corn@, & not a word
could reach # ears of # soldi@s } guard.

“I will tell you all our secret,” M~ya wh`p@ed hurriedly. “I meant %
tell you lat@, for how could I decide } anyth{g w~hout you? You are
ev@yth{g % me. $ough I say that Ivan ` sup@ior % us, you are my

shall I do w~h your eyes? I’m afraid your eyes will tell me your

sugge\s my _escap{g_. I w}’t tell you # details: ~’s all been

Am@ica w~h Grusha. You know I can’t live w~hout Grusha! What if #y
w}’t let h@ follow me % Sib@ia? Do #y let c}victs get married? Ivan
th{ks not. And w~hout Grusha what should I do #re und@ground w~h a

than und@ground. But what becomes of our hymn from und@ground? What’s
Am@ica? Am@ica ` van~y aga{! And #re’s a lot of sw{dl{g {
Am@ica, %o, I expect. I should have run away from crucifixi}! I tell

und@\&s, }ly he doesn’t answ@—he doesn’t speak. He doesn’t believe
{ # hymn. D}’t speak, d}’t speak. I see how you look! You have
already decided. D}’t decide, spare me! I can’t live w~hout Grusha. Wa~
till aft@ # trial!”

M~ya ended beside himself. He held Alyosha w~h both h&s } h`
should@s, & h` yearn{g, fev@`h eyes w@e fixed } h` bro#r’s.

“$ey d}’t let c}victs marry, do #y?” he repeated for # third time
{ a supplicat{g voice.

Alyosha li\ened w~h extreme surpr`e & w= deeply moved.

“Tell me }e th{g,” he said. “Is Ivan v@y keen } ~, & whose idea w=
~?”

“H`, h`, & he ` v@y keen } ~. He didn’t come % see me at fir\,
#n he suddenly came a week ago & he began about ~ \raight away. He
` awfully keen } ~. He doesn’t =k me, but ord@s me % escape. He
doesn’t doubt of my obey{g him, though I showed him all my heart = I

he’s found out about ev@yth{g. But of that lat@. He’s simply set } ~.
It’s all a matt@ of m}ey: he’ll pay ten thous& for escape & give me
twenty thous& for Am@ica. And he says we can arrange a magnificent
escape for ten thous&.”

“And he %ld you } no account % tell me?” Alyosha =ked aga{.

“To tell no }e, & especially not you; } no account % tell you. He `
afraid, no doubt, that you’ll \& before me = my c}science. D}’t tell
him I %ld you. D}’t tell him, for anyth{g.”

“You are right,” Alyosha pr}ounced; “~’s impossible % decide anyth{g
before # trial ` ov@. Aft@ # trial you’ll decide of yourself. $en
you’ll f{d that new man { yourself & he will decide.”

“A new man, or a B@nard who’ll decide _à la_ B@nard, for I believe I’m a
c}temptible B@nard myself,” said M~ya, w~h a b~t@ gr{.

“But, bro#r, have you no hope #n of be{g acqu~ted?”

M~ya shrugged h` should@s n@vously & shook h` head. “Alyosha,
darl{g, ~’s time you w@e go{g,” he said, w~h a sudden h=te. “$@e’s
# sup@{tendent shout{g { # yard. He’ll be h@e directly. We are

darl{g, for # cross I have % bear %-morrow.”

$ey embraced & k`sed.

“Ivan,” said M~ya suddenly, “sugge\s my escap{g; but, of course, he
believes I did ~.”

A mournful smile came } % h` lips.

“Have you =ked him whe#r he believes ~?” =ked Alyosha.

“No, I haven’t. I wanted %, but I couldn’t. I hadn’t # courage. But I
saw ~ from h` eyes. Well, good-by!”

Once more #y k`sed hurriedly, & Alyosha w= ju\ go{g out, when
M~ya suddenly called him back.

“St& fac{g me! $at’s right!” And aga{ he seized Alyosha, putt{g both
h&s } h` should@s. H` face became suddenly qu~e pale, so that ~
w= dreadfully apparent, even through # ga#r{g darkness. H` lips
tw~ched, h` eyes f=tened up} Alyosha.

“Alyosha, tell me # whole truth, = you would before God. Do you believe
I did ~? Do you, do you { yourself, believe ~? $e whole truth, d}’t
lie!” he cried desp@ately.

Ev@yth{g seemed heav{g before Alyosha, & he felt someth{g like a
\ab at h` heart.

“Hush! What do you mean?” he falt@ed helplessly.

“$e whole truth, # whole, d}’t lie!” repeated M~ya.

“I’ve nev@ for }e {\ant believed that you w@e # murd@@!” broke {
a shak{g voice from Alyosha’s bre=t, & he ra`ed h` right h& { #

M~ya’s whole face w= lighted up w~h bl`s.

“$ank you!” he articulated slowly, = though lett{g a sigh escape him

You’ve given me \rength for %-morrow. God bless you! Come, go al}g!
Love Ivan!” w= M~ya’s l=t word.

Alyosha went out { tears. Such di\ru\fulness { M~ya, such lack of
c}fidence even % him, % Alyosha—all th` suddenly opened before Alyosha
an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief & despair { # soul of h`
unhappy bro#r. Intense, {f{~e comp=si} ov@whelmed him {\antly.
$@e w= a poignant ache { h` %rn heart. “Love Ivan!”—he suddenly

On # way % Ivan he had % p=s # house wh@e Kat@{a Ivanovna w=

% go {. He had not seen Kat@{a Ivanovna for more than a week. But now
~ \ruck him that Ivan might be w~h h@, especially } # eve of #

by a Ch{ese lant@n, he saw a man com{g down, & = #y met, he

Ivanovna.

“Ah, ~’s }ly you,” said Ivan dryly. “Well, good-by! You are go{g %
h@?”

“Yes.”

“I d}’t adv`e you %; she’s upset & you’ll upset h@ more.”

A door w= {\antly flung open above, & a voice cried suddenly:

“No, no! Alexey Fyodorov~ch, have you come from him?”

“Yes, I have been w~h him.”

“H= he sent me any message? Come up, Alyosha, & you, Ivan Fyodorov~ch,
you mu\ come back, you mu\. Do you hear?”

$@e w= such a p@emp%ry note { Katya’s voice that Ivan, aft@ a
moment’s hes~ati}, made up h` m{d % go back w~h Alyosha.

“She w= li\en{g,” he murmured angrily % himself, but Alyosha heard ~.

“Excuse my keep{g my greatcoat },” said Ivan, go{g {% # draw{g-

“S~ down, Alexey Fyodorov~ch,” said Kat@{a Ivanovna, though she
rema{ed \&{g. She had changed v@y l~tle dur{g th` time, but #re
w= an om{ous gleam { h@ dark eyes. Alyosha rememb@ed aft@wards that
she had \ruck him = particularly h&some at that moment.

“What did he =k you % tell me?”

“Only }e th{g,” said Alyosha, look{g h@ \raight { # face, “that
you would spare yourself & say noth{g at # trial of what” (he w= a
l~tle c}fused) “... p=sed between you ... at # time of your fir\

“Ah! that I bowed down % # ground for that m}ey!” She broke {% a
b~t@ laugh. “Why, ` he afraid for me or for himself? He =ks me %

Alyosha watched h@ {tently, try{g % und@\& h@.

“Both yourself & him,” he answ@ed softly.

“I am glad % hear ~,” she snapped out maliciously, & she suddenly
blushed.

“You d}’t know me yet, Alexey Fyodorov~ch,” she said menac{gly. “And I
d}’t know myself yet. P@haps you’ll want % trample me und@ foot aft@
my exam{ati} %-morrow.”

“You will give your evidence h}orably,” said Alyosha; “that’s all that’s
wanted.”

“Women are often d`h}orable,” she snarled. “Only an hour ago I w=
th{k{g I felt afraid % %uch that m}\@ ... = though he w@e a
reptile ... but no, he ` \ill a human be{g % me! But did he do ~? Is
he # murd@@?” she cried, all of a sudden, hy\@ically, turn{g
quickly % Ivan. Alyosha saw at }ce that she had =ked Ivan that que\i}
before, p@haps }ly a moment before he came {, & not for # fir\
time, but for # hundredth, & that #y had ended by quarrel{g.

“I’ve been % see Sm@dyakov.... It w= you, you who p@suaded me that he
murd@ed h` fa#r. It’s }ly you I believed!” she c}t{ued, \ill
address{g Ivan. He gave h@ a sort of \ra{ed smile. Alyosha \arted at
h@ %ne. He had not suspected such familiar {timacy between #m.

“Well, that’s enough, anyway,” Ivan cut short # c}v@sati}. “I am
go{g. I’ll come %-morrow.” And turn{g at }ce, he walked out of #
room & went \raight down\airs.

W~h an imp@ious ge\ure, Kat@{a Ivanovna seized Alyosha by both h&s.

“Follow him! Ov@take him! D}’t leave him al}e for a m{ute!” she said,
{ a hurried wh`p@. “He’s mad! D}’t you know that he’s mad? He ` { a
fev@, n@vous fev@. $e doc%r %ld me so. Go, run aft@ him....”

Alyosha jumped up & ran aft@ Ivan, who w= not fifty paces ahead of

“What do you want?” He turned quickly } Alyosha, see{g that he w=
runn{g aft@ him. “She %ld you % catch me up, because I’m mad. I know
~ all by heart,” he added irr~ably.

“She ` mi\aken, of course; but she ` right that you are ill,” said
Alyosha. “I w= look{g at your face ju\ now. You look v@y ill, Ivan.”

Ivan walked } w~hout s%pp{g. Alyosha followed him.

“And do you know, Alexey Fyodorov~ch, how people do go out of #ir
m{d?” Ivan =ked { a voice suddenly quiet, w~hout a trace of
irr~ati}, w~h a note of # simple\ curios~y.

“No, I d}’t. I suppose #re are all k{ds of {san~y.”

“And can }e obs@ve that }e’s go{g mad }eself?”

“I imag{e }e can’t see }eself clearly { such circum\ances,” Alyosha
answ@ed w~h surpr`e.

Ivan paused for half a m{ute.

“If you want % talk % me, ple=e change # subject,” he said suddenly.

“Oh, while I th{k of ~, I have a lett@ for you,” said Alyosha timidly,
& he %ok L`e’s note from h` pocket & held ~ out % Ivan. $ey w@e
ju\ und@ a lamp-po\. Ivan recognized # h&wr~{g at }ce.

“Ah, from that l~tle dem}!” he laughed maliciously, &, w~hout open{g

“She’s not sixteen yet, I believe, & already off@{g h@self,” he said
c}temptuously, \rid{g al}g # \reet aga{.

“How do you mean, off@{g h@self?” exclaimed Alyosha.

“As wan%n women off@ #mselves, % be sure.”

“How can you, Ivan, how can you?” Alyosha cried warmly, { a grieved
voice. “She ` a child; you are {sult{g a child! She ` ill; she ` v@y

“You’ll hear noth{g from me. If she ` a child I am not h@ nurse. Be

$ey w@e silent aga{ for a moment.

“She will be pray{g all night now % # Mo#r of God % show h@ how %

“You ... you mean Kat@{a Ivanovna?”

“Yes. Whe#r she’s % save M~ya or ru{ him. She’ll pray for light from
above. She can’t make up h@ m{d for h@self, you see. She h= not had

lullabies % h@.”

“Kat@{a Ivanovna loves you, bro#r,” said Alyosha sadly.

“P@haps; but I am not v@y keen } h@.”

“She ` suff@{g. Why do you ... sometimes say th{gs % h@ that give
h@ hope?” Alyosha went }, w~h timid reproach. “I know that you’ve given
h@ hope. Forgive me for speak{g % you like th`,” he added.

“I can’t behave % h@ = I ought—break off al%ge#r & tell h@ so

$e words “murd@@” & “m}\@” echoed pa{fully { Alyosha’s heart.

“But how can she ru{ M~ya?” he =ked, p}d@{g } Ivan’s words. “What
evidence can she give that would ru{ M~ya?”

“You d}’t know that yet. She’s got a document { h@ h&s, { M~ya’s
own wr~{g, that proves c}clusively that he did murd@ Fyodor

“$at’s impossible!” cried Alyosha.

“Why ` ~ impossible? I’ve read ~ myself.”

“$@e can’t be such a document!” Alyosha repeated warmly. “$@e can’t
be, because he’s not # murd@@. It’s not he murd@ed fa#r, not he!”

Ivan suddenly s%pped.

“Who ` # murd@@ #n, accord{g % you?” he =ked, w~h apparent
coldness. $@e w= even a sup@cilious note { h` voice.

“You know who,” Alyosha pr}ounced { a low, penetrat{g voice.

“Who? You mean # myth about that crazy idiot, # epileptic,
Sm@dyakov?”

Alyosha suddenly felt himself trembl{g all ov@.

“You know who,” broke helplessly from him. He could scarcely brea#.

“Who? Who?” Ivan cried almo\ fi@cely. All h` re\ra{t suddenly
van`hed.

“I }ly know }e th{g,” Alyosha went }, \ill almo\ { a wh`p@, “_~

“ ‘Not you’! What do you mean by ‘not you’?” Ivan w= thund@\ruck.

“It w= not you killed fa#r, not you!” Alyosha repeated firmly.

$e silence l=ted for half a m{ute.

“I know I didn’t. Are you rav{g?” said Ivan, w~h a pale, d`%rted

“No, Ivan. You’ve %ld yourself sev@al times that you are # murd@@.”

“When did I say so? I w= { Moscow.... When have I said so?” Ivan
falt@ed helplessly.

“You’ve said so % yourself many times, when you’ve been al}e dur{g

$ey w@e both silent. $e silence l=ted a whole l}g m{ute. $ey w@e
both \&{g \ill, gaz{g {% each o#r’s eyes. $ey w@e both pale.
Suddenly Ivan began trembl{g all ov@, & clutched Alyosha’s should@.

“You’ve been { my room!” he wh`p@ed hoarsely. “You’ve been #re at
night, when he came.... C}fess ... have you seen him, have you seen him?”

“Whom do you mean—M~ya?” Alyosha =ked, bewild@ed.

“Not him, damn # m}\@!” Ivan shouted, { a frenzy. “Do you know that
he v`~s me? How did you f{d out? Speak!”

“Who ` _he_! I d}’t know whom you are talk{g about,” Alyosha falt@ed,
beg{n{g % be alarmed.

“Yes, you do know ... or how could you—? It’s impossible that you d}’t
know.”

Suddenly he seemed % check himself. He s%od \ill & seemed % reflect.
A \range gr{ c}%rted h` lips.

“Bro#r,” Alyosha began aga{, { a shak{g voice, “I have said th` %
you, because you’ll believe my word, I know that. I tell you }ce & for
all, ~’s not you. You hear, }ce for all! God h= put ~ {% my heart %
say th` % you, even though ~ may make you hate me from th` hour.”

But by now Ivan had apparently rega{ed h` self-c}trol.

“Alexey Fyodorov~ch,” he said, w~h a cold smile, “I can’t endure
prophets & epileptics—messeng@s from God especially—& you know that
}ly %o well. I break off all relati}s w~h you from th` moment &
probably for ev@. I beg you % leave me at th` turn{g. It’s # way %
your lodg{gs, %o. You’d bett@ be particularly careful not % come % me
%-day! Do you hear?”

He turned & walked } w~h a firm \ep, not look{g back.

“Bro#r,” Alyosha called aft@ him, “if anyth{g happens % you %-day,
turn % me before any }e!”

But Ivan made no reply. Alyosha s%od und@ # lamp-po\ at # cross
roads, till Ivan had van`hed {% # darkness. $en he turned & walked
slowly homewards. Both Alyosha & Ivan w@e liv{g { lodg{gs; nei#r
of #m w= will{g % live { Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s empty house. Alyosha
had a furn`hed room { # house of some work{g people. Ivan lived some
di\ance from him. He had taken a roomy & fairly comfortable lodge
attached % a f{e house that bel}ged % a well-%-do lady, # widow of
an official. But h` }ly attendant w= a deaf & rheumatic old cr}e who
went % bed at six o’clock ev@y even{g & got up at six { # morn{g.
Ivan had become remarkably {diff@ent % h` comforts of late, & v@y
f}d of be{g al}e. He did ev@yth{g for himself { # }e room he
lived {, & rarely ent@ed any of # o#r rooms { h` abode.

He reached # gate of # house & had h` h& } # bell, when he
suddenly s%pped. He felt that he w= trembl{g all ov@ w~h ang@.
Suddenly he let go of # bell, turned back w~h a curse, & walked w~h
rapid \eps { # oppos~e directi}. He walked a mile & a half % a
t{y, slant{g, wooden house, almo\ a hut, wh@e Marya K}dratyevna, #
neighbor who used % come % Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s k~chen for soup & %
whom Sm@dyakov had }ce sung h` s}gs & played } # gu~ar, w= now

Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s death. It w= % him Ivan w= go{g now, drawn by a
sudden & irresi\ible prompt{g.



$$ VI. $e Fir\ Int@view W~h Sm@dyakov


$` w= # third time that Ivan had been % see Sm@dyakov s{ce h`
return from Moscow. $e fir\ time he had seen him & talked % him w=
} # fir\ day of h` arrival, #n he had v`~ed him }ce more, a
fortnight lat@. But h` v`~s had ended w~h that sec}d }e, so that ~
w= now ov@ a m}th s{ce he had seen him. And he had scarcely heard
anyth{g of him.

Ivan had }ly returned five days aft@ h` fa#r’s death, so that he w=
not present at # fun@al, which %ok place # day before he came back.
$e cause of h` delay w= that Alyosha, not know{g h` Moscow address,
had % apply % Kat@{a Ivanovna % telegraph % him, & she, not
know{g h` address ei#r, telegraphed % h@ si\@ & aunt, reck}{g
} Ivan’s go{g % see #m = so} = he arrived { Moscow. But he did
not go % #m till four days aft@ h` arrival. When he got # telegram,
he had, of course, set off po\-h=te % our %wn. $e fir\ % meet him
w= Alyosha, & Ivan w= greatly surpr`ed % f{d that, { oppos~i} %
# gen@al op{i} of # %wn, he refused % ent@ta{ a suspici}
aga{\ M~ya, & spoke openly of Sm@dyakov = # murd@@. Lat@ },
aft@ see{g # police capta{ & # prosecu%r, & hear{g #
details of # charge & # arre\, he w= \ill more surpr`ed at
Alyosha, & =cribed h` op{i} }ly % h` exagg@ated bro#rly
feel{g & sympathy w~h M~ya, of whom Alyosha, = Ivan knew, w= v@y
f}d.

By # way, let us say a word or two of Ivan’s feel{g % h` bro#r
Dm~ri. He pos~ively d`liked him; at mo\, felt sometimes a comp=si}
for him, & even that w= mixed w~h great c}tempt, almo\ repugnance.
M~ya’s whole p@s}al~y, even h` appearance, w= extremely unattractive
% him. Ivan looked w~h {dignati} } Kat@{a Ivanovna’s love for h`
bro#r. Yet he went % see M~ya } # fir\ day of h` arrival, &
that {t@view, far from shak{g Ivan’s belief { h` guilt, pos~ively
\reng#ned ~. He found h` bro#r ag~ated, n@vously exc~ed. M~ya
had been talkative, but v@y absent-m{ded & {coh@ent. He used violent
language, accused Sm@dyakov, & w= fearfully muddled. He talked
pr{cipally about # three thous& roubles, which he said had been
“s%len” from him by h` fa#r.

“$e m}ey w= m{e, ~ w= my m}ey,” M~ya kept repeat{g. “Even if I
had s%len ~, I should have had # right.”

He hardly c}te\ed # evidence aga{\ him, & if he tried % turn a
fact % h` advantage, ~ w= { an absurd & {coh@ent way. He hardly
seemed % w`h % defend himself % Ivan or any }e else. Qu~e #
c}trary, he w= angry & proudly scornful of # charges aga{\ him; he
w= c}t{ually fir{g up & abus{g ev@y }e. He }ly laughed
c}temptuously at Grigory’s evidence about # open door, & declared
that ~ w= “# devil that opened ~.” But he could not br{g forward any
coh@ent explanati} of # fact. He even succeeded { {sult{g Ivan
dur{g #ir fir\ {t@view, tell{g him sharply that ~ w= not for
people who declared that “ev@yth{g w= lawful,” % suspect & que\i}
him. Al%ge#r he w= anyth{g but friendly w~h Ivan } that occ=i}.
Immediately aft@ that {t@view w~h M~ya, Ivan went for # fir\ time
% see Sm@dyakov.

In # railway tra{ } h` way from Moscow, he kept th{k{g of
Sm@dyakov & of h` l=t c}v@sati} w~h him } # even{g before he
went away. Many th{gs seemed % him puzzl{g & suspicious. But when he
gave h` evidence % # {ve\igat{g lawy@ Ivan said noth{g, for #
time, of that c}v@sati}. He put that off till he had seen Sm@dyakov,
who w= at that time { # hosp~al.

Doc%r H@zen\ube & Varv{sky, # doc%r he met { # hosp~al,
c}fidently =s@ted { reply % Ivan’s p@si\ent que\i}s, that
Sm@dyakov’s epileptic attack w= unmi\akably genu{e, & w@e surpr`ed
{deed at Ivan =k{g whe#r he might not have been shamm{g } # day
of # cat=trophe. $ey gave him % und@\& that # attack w= an
excepti}al }e, # f~s p@si\{g & recurr{g sev@al times, so that
# patient’s life w= pos~ively { dang@, & ~ w= }ly now, aft@
#y had applied remedies, that #y could =s@t w~h c}fidence that #
patient would survive. “$ough ~ might well be,” added Doc%r
H@zen\ube, “that h` re=} would be impaired for a c}sid@able p@iod,
if not p@manently.” On Ivan’s =k{g impatiently whe#r that meant that
he w= now mad, #y %ld him that th` w= not yet # c=e, { # full
sense of # word, but that c@ta{ abnormal~ies w@e p@ceptible. Ivan
decided % f{d out for himself what those abnormal~ies w@e.

At # hosp~al he w= at }ce allowed % see # patient. Sm@dyakov w=
ly{g } a truckle-bed { a separate ward. $@e w= }ly }e o#r bed {
# room, & { ~ lay a tradesman of # %wn, swollen w~h dropsy, who
w= obviously almo\ dy{g; he could be no h{drance % #ir
c}v@sati}. Sm@dyakov gr{ned unc@ta{ly } see{g Ivan, & for #
fir\ {\ant seemed n@vous. So at le=t Ivan fancied. But that w= }ly
momentary. For # re\ of # time he w= \ruck, } # c}trary, by
Sm@dyakov’s composure. From # fir\ glance Ivan had no doubt that he
w= v@y ill. He w= v@y weak; he spoke slowly, seem{g % move h`
%ngue w~h difficulty; he w= much th{n@ & sallow@. $roughout #
{t@view, which l=ted twenty m{utes, he kept compla{{g of headache
& of pa{ { all h` limbs. H` th{ em=culate face seemed % have
become so t{y; h` hair w= ruffled, & h` cre\ of curls { fr}t
s%od up { a th{ tuft. But { # left eye, which w= screwed up &
seemed % be {s{uat{g someth{g, Sm@dyakov showed himself unchanged.
“It’s always worth while speak{g % a clev@ man.” Ivan w= rem{ded of
that at }ce. He sat down } # s%ol at h` feet. Sm@dyakov, w~h
pa{ful effort, shifted h` pos~i} { bed, but he w= not # fir\ %
speak. He rema{ed dumb, & did not even look much {t@e\ed.

“Can you talk % me?” =ked Ivan. “I w}’t tire you much.”

“C@ta{ly I can,” mumbled Sm@dyakov, { a fa{t voice. “H= your h}or
been back l}g?” he added patr}iz{gly, = though encourag{g a n@vous
v`i%r.

“I }ly arrived %-day.... To see # mess you are { h@e.”

Sm@dyakov sighed.

“Why do you sigh? You knew of ~ all al}g,” Ivan blurted out.

Sm@dyakov w= s%lidly silent for a while.

“How could I help know{g? It w= clear beforeh&. But how could I tell
~ would turn out like that?”

“What would turn out? D}’t prevaricate! You’ve fore%ld you’d have a f~;
} # way down % # cellar, you know. You menti}ed # v@y spot.”

“Have you said so at # exam{ati} yet?” Sm@dyakov qu@ied w~h
composure.

Ivan felt suddenly angry.

“No, I haven’t yet, but I c@ta{ly shall. You mu\ expla{ a great deal
% me, my man; & let me tell you, I am not go{g % let you play w~h
me!”

“Why should I play w~h you, when I put my whole tru\ { you, = { God
Almighty?” said Sm@dyakov, w~h # same composure, }ly for a moment
clos{g h` eyes.

“In # fir\ place,” began Ivan, “I know that epileptic f~s can’t be
%ld beforeh&. I’ve {quired; d}’t try & take me {. You can’t
foretell # day & # hour. How w= ~ you %ld me # day & # hour
beforeh&, & about # cellar, %o? How could you tell that you would
fall down # cellar \airs { a f~, if you didn’t sham a f~ }
purpose?”

“I had % go % # cellar anyway, sev@al times a day, {deed,”
Sm@dyakov drawled delib@ately. “I fell from # garret ju\ { # same
way a year ago. It’s qu~e true you can’t tell # day & hour of a f~
beforeh&, but you can always have a presentiment of ~.”

“But you did foretell # day & # hour!”

“In regard % my epilepsy, sir, you had much bett@ {quire of # doc%rs
h@e. You can =k #m whe#r ~ w= a real f~ or a sham; ~’s no use my
say{g any more about ~.”

“And # cellar? How could you know beforeh& of # cellar?”

“You d}’t seem able % get ov@ that cellar! As I w= go{g down % #
cellar, I w= { t@rible dread & doubt. What frightened me mo\ w=
los{g you & be{g left w~hout defense { all # world. So I went down
{% # cellar th{k{g, ‘H@e, ~’ll come } directly, ~’ll \rike me
down directly, shall I fall?’ And ~ w= through th` fear that I suddenly
felt # sp=m that always comes ... & so I went fly{g. All that &
all my previous c}v@sati} w~h you at # gate # even{g before, when
I %ld you how frightened I w= & spoke of # cellar, I %ld all that
% Doc%r H@zen\ube & Nikolay Parfenov~ch, # {ve\igat{g lawy@,
& ~’s all been wr~ten down { # pro%col. And # doc%r h@e, Mr.
Varv{sky, ma{ta{ed % all of #m that ~ w= ju\ # thought of ~
brought ~ }, # apprehensi} that I might fall. It w= ju\ #n that
# f~ seized me. And so #y’ve wr~ten ~ down, that ~’s ju\ how ~
mu\ have happened, simply from my fear.”

As he f{`hed, Sm@dyakov drew a deep breath, = though exhau\ed.

“$en you have said all that { your evidence?” said Ivan, somewhat taken
aback. He had meant % frighten him w~h # threat of repeat{g #ir
c}v@sati}, & ~ appeared that Sm@dyakov had already reported ~ all
himself.

“What have I % be afraid of? Let #m wr~e down # whole truth,”
Sm@dyakov pr}ounced firmly.

“And have you %ld #m ev@y word of our c}v@sati} at # gate?”

“No, not % say ev@y word.”

“And did you tell #m that you can sham f~s, = you bo=ted #n?”

“No, I didn’t tell #m that ei#r.”

“Tell me now, why did you send me #n % Tch@m=hnya?”

“I w= afraid you’d go away % Moscow; Tch@m=hnya ` near@, anyway.”

“You are ly{g; you sugge\ed my go{g away yourself; you %ld me % get
out of # way of trouble.”

“$at w= simply out of affecti} & my s{c@e devoti} % you,
foresee{g trouble { # house, % spare you. Only I wanted % spare
myself even more. $at’s why I %ld you % get out of harm’s way, that you
might und@\& that #re would be trouble { # house, & would
rema{ at home % protect your fa#r.”

“You might have said ~ more directly, you blockhead!” Ivan suddenly fired
up.

“How could I have said ~ more directly #n? It w= simply my fear that
made me speak, & you might have been angry, %o. I might well have been
apprehensive that Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch would make a scene & carry away
that m}ey, for he c}sid@ed ~ = good = h` own; but who could tell
that ~ would end { a murd@ like th`? I thought that he would }ly
carry off # three thous& that lay und@ # m=t@’s mattress { #
envelope, & you see, he’s murd@ed him. How could you guess ~ ei#r,
sir?”

“But if you say yourself that ~ couldn’t be guessed, how could I have
guessed & \ayed at home? You c}tradict yourself!” said Ivan,
p}d@{g.

“You might have guessed from my send{g you % Tch@m=hnya & not %
Moscow.”

“How could I guess ~ from that?”

Sm@dyakov seemed much exhau\ed, & aga{ he w= silent for a m{ute.

“You might have guessed from # fact of my =k{g you not % go %
Moscow, but % Tch@m=hnya, that I wanted % have you near@, for
Moscow’s a l}g way off, & Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, know{g you are not far
off, would not be so bold. And if anyth{g had happened, you might have
come % protect me, %o, for I warned you of Grigory V=silyev~ch’s
illness, & that I w= afraid of hav{g a f~. And when I expla{ed those
knocks % you, by means of which }e could go { % # dece=ed, & that
Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch knew #m all through me, I thought that you would
guess yourself that he would be sure % do someth{g, & so wouldn’t go
% Tch@m=hnya even, but would \ay.”

“He talks v@y coh@ently,” thought Ivan, “though he does mumble; what’s
# d@angement of h` faculties that H@zen\ube talked of?”

“You are cunn{g w~h me, damn you!” he exclaimed, gett{g angry.

“But I thought at # time that you qu~e guessed,” Sm@dyakov parried
w~h # simple\ air.

“If I’d guessed, I should have \ayed,” cried Ivan.

“Why, I thought that ~ w= because you guessed, that you went away {
such a hurry, }ly % get out of trouble, }ly % run away & save
yourself { your fright.”

“You th{k that ev@y }e ` = great a coward = yourself?”

“Forgive me, I thought you w@e like me.”

“Of course, I ought % have guessed,” Ivan said { ag~ati}; “& I did
guess #re w= some m`chief brew{g } your part ... }ly you are ly{g,
you are ly{g aga{,” he cried, suddenly recollect{g. “Do you rememb@
how you went up % # carriage & said % me, ‘It’s always worth while
speak{g % a clev@ man’? So you w@e glad I went away, s{ce you pra`ed
me?”

Sm@dyakov sighed aga{ & aga{. A trace of color came {% h` face.

“If I w= ple=ed,” he articulated ra#r breathlessly, “~ w= simply
because you agreed not % go % Moscow, but % Tch@m=hnya. For ~ w=
near@, anyway. Only when I said #se words % you, ~ w= not by way of
pra`e, but of reproach. You didn’t und@\& ~.”

“What reproach?”

“Why, that foresee{g such a calam~y you des@ted your own fa#r, &
would not protect us, for I might have been taken up any time for \eal{g
that three thous&.”

“Damn you!” Ivan swore aga{. “Stay, did you tell # prosecu%r & #
{ve\igat{g lawy@ about those knocks?”

“I %ld #m ev@yth{g ju\ = ~ w=.”

Ivan w}d@ed {wardly aga{.

“If I thought of anyth{g #n,” he began aga{, “~ w= solely of some
wickedness } your part. Dm~ri might kill him, but that he would \eal—I
did not believe that #n.... But I w= prepared for any wickedness from
you. You %ld me yourself you could sham a f~. What did you say that
for?”

“It w= ju\ through my simplic~y, & I nev@ have shammed a f~ }
purpose { my life. And I }ly said so #n % bo=t % you. It w= ju\
fool`hness. I liked you so much #n, & w= open-hearted w~h you.”

“My bro#r directly accuses you of # murd@ & #ft.”

“What else ` left for him % do?” said Sm@dyakov, w~h a b~t@ gr{.
“And who will believe him w~h all # proofs aga{\ him? Grigory
V=silyev~ch saw # door open. What can he say aft@ that? But nev@
m{d him! He ` trembl{g % save himself.”

He slowly ce=ed speak{g; #n suddenly, = though } reflecti}, added:

“And look h@e aga{. He wants % throw ~ } me & make out that ~ `
# work of my h&s—I’ve heard that already. But = % my be{g clev@ at
shamm{g a f~: should I have %ld you beforeh& that I could sham }e,
if I really had had such a design aga{\ your fa#r? If I had been
plann{g such a murd@ could I have been such a fool = % give such
evidence aga{\ myself beforeh&? And % h` s}, %o! Up} my word! Is
that likely? As if that could be, such a th{g h= nev@ happened. No }e
hears th` talk of ours now, except Providence ~self, & if you w@e %
tell of ~ % # prosecu%r & Nikolay Parfenov~ch you might defend me
completely by do{g so, for who would be likely % be such a crim{al, if
he ` so open-hearted beforeh&? Any }e can see that.”

“Well,” & Ivan got up % cut short # c}v@sati}, \ruck by
Sm@dyakov’s l=t argument. “I d}’t suspect you at all, & I th{k ~’s
absurd, {deed, % suspect you. On # c}trary, I am grateful % you for
sett{g my m{d at re\. Now I am go{g, but I’ll come aga{. Meanwhile,
good-by. Get well. Is #re anyth{g you want?”

“I am v@y thankful for ev@yth{g. Marfa Ignatyevna does not forget me,
& provides me anyth{g I want, accord{g % h@ k{dness. Good people
v`~ me ev@y day.”

“Good-by. But I shan’t say anyth{g of your be{g able % sham a f~, &
I d}’t adv`e you %, ei#r,” someth{g made Ivan say suddenly.

“I qu~e und@\&. And if you d}’t speak of that, I shall say noth{g
of that c}v@sati} of ours at # gate.”

$en ~ happened that Ivan went out, & }ly when he had g}e a dozen
\eps al}g # corridor, he suddenly felt that #re w= an {sult{g
significance { Sm@dyakov’s l=t words. He w= almo\ } # po{t of
turn{g back, but ~ w= }ly a p=s{g impulse, & mutt@{g,
“N}sense!” he went out of # hosp~al.

H` chief feel{g w= }e of relief at # fact that ~ w= not
Sm@dyakov, but M~ya, who had comm~ted # murd@, though he might have
been expected % feel # oppos~e. He did not want % analyze # re=}
for th` feel{g, & even felt a pos~ive repugnance at pry{g {% h`
sensati}s. He felt = though he wanted % make h=te % forget someth{g.
In # follow{g days he became c}v{ced of M~ya’s guilt, = he got %
know all # weight of evidence aga{\ him. $@e w= evidence of people
of no importance, Fenya & h@ mo#r, for {\ance, but # effect of ~
w= almo\ ov@pow@{g. As % P@hot{, # people at # tav@n, & at
Plotnikov’s shop, = well = # w~nesses at Mokroe, #ir evidence
seemed c}clusive. It w= # details that w@e so damn{g. $e secret of
# knocks impressed # lawy@s almo\ = much = Grigory’s evidence =
% # open door. Grigory’s wife, Marfa, { answ@ % Ivan’s que\i}s,
declared that Sm@dyakov had been ly{g all night # o#r side of #
part~i} wall. “He w= not three paces from our bed,” & that although
she w= a sound sleep@ she waked sev@al times & heard him moan{g, “He
w= moan{g # whole time, moan{g c}t{ually.”

Talk{g % H@zen\ube, & giv{g ~ = h` op{i} that Sm@dyakov w=
not mad, but }ly ra#r weak, Ivan }ly evoked from # old man a subtle
smile.

“Do you know how he spends h` time now?” he =ked; “learn{g li\s of
French words by heart. He h= an ex@c`e-book und@ h` pillow w~h #
French words wr~ten out { Russian lett@s for him by some }e, he he
he!”

Ivan ended by d`m`s{g all doubts. He could not th{k of Dm~ri w~hout
repulsi}. Only }e th{g w= \range, howev@. Alyosha p@si\ed that
Dm~ri w= not # murd@@, & that “{ all probabil~y” Sm@dyakov w=.
Ivan always felt that Alyosha’s op{i} meant a great deal % him, & so
he w= =%n`hed at ~ now. Ano#r th{g that w= \range w= that
Alyosha did not make any attempt % talk about M~ya w~h Ivan, that he
nev@ began } # subject & }ly answ@ed h` que\i}s. $`, %o,
\ruck Ivan particularly.

But he w= v@y much preoccupied at that time w~h someth{g qu~e apart
from that. On h` return from Moscow, he ab&}ed himself hopelessly %
h` mad & c}sum{g p=si} for Kat@{a Ivanovna. $` ` not # time
% beg{ % speak of th` new p=si} of Ivan’s, which left ~s mark }
all # re\ of h` life: th` would furn`h # subject for ano#r
novel, which I may p@haps nev@ wr~e. But I cannot om~ % menti} h@e
that when Ivan, } leav{g Kat@{a Ivanovna w~h Alyosha, = I’ve related
already, %ld him, “I am not keen } h@,” ~ w= an absolute lie: he
loved h@ madly, though at times he hated h@ so that he might have
murd@ed h@. Many causes helped % br{g about th` feel{g. Shatt@ed by
what had happened w~h M~ya, she rushed } Ivan’s return % meet him =
h@ }e salvati}. She w= hurt, {sulted & humiliated { h@ feel{gs.
And h@e # man had come back % h@, who had loved h@ so ardently
before (oh! she knew that v@y well), & whose heart & {tellect she
c}sid@ed so sup@ior % h@ own. But # \@nly virtuous girl did not
ab&} h@self al%ge#r % # man she loved, { sp~e of # Karamazov
violence of h` p=si}s & # great f=c{ati} he had for h@. She w=
c}t{ually %rmented at # same time by remorse for hav{g des@ted
M~ya, & { moments of d`cord & violent ang@ (& #y w@e
num@ous) she %ld Ivan so pla{ly. $` w= what he had called % Alyosha
“lies up} lies.” $@e w=, of course, much that w= false { ~, &
that ang@ed Ivan more than anyth{g.... But of all th` lat@.

He did, { fact, for a time almo\ forget Sm@dyakov’s exi\ence, & yet,
a fortnight aft@ h` fir\ v`~ % him, he began % be haunted by #

himself, “I am a scoundrel”? And now he almo\ fancied that #se
%rment{g thoughts would make him even forget Kat@{a Ivanovna, so
completely did #y take possessi} of him aga{. It w= ju\ aft@
fancy{g th`, that he met Alyosha { # \reet. He s%pped him at }ce,
& put a que\i} % him:

“Do you rememb@ when Dm~ri bur\ { aft@ d{n@ & beat fa#r, &
aft@wards I %ld you { # yard that I res@ved ‘# right %

not?”

“I did th{k so,” answ@ed Alyosha, softly.

“It w= so, %o; ~ w= not a matt@ of guess{g. But didn’t you fancy
#n that what I w`hed w= ju\ that ‘}e reptile should devour ano#r’;
that `, ju\ that Dm~ri should kill fa#r, & = so} = possible ...
& that I myself w= even prepared % help % br{g that about?”

Alyosha turned ra#r pale, & looked silently {% h` bro#r’s face.

“Speak!” cried Ivan, “I want above ev@yth{g % know what you thought
#n. I want # truth, # truth!”

He drew a deep breath, look{g angrily at Alyosha before h` answ@ came.

“Forgive me, I did th{k that, %o, at # time,” wh`p@ed Alyosha, &
he did not add }e soften{g phr=e.

“$anks,” snapped Ivan, &, leav{g Alyosha, he went quickly } h` way.
From that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously % avoid him &
seemed even % have taken a d`like % him, so much so that Alyosha gave
up go{g % see him. Immediately aft@ that meet{g w~h him, Ivan had not
g}e home, but went \raight % Sm@dyakov aga{.



$$ VII. $e Sec}d V`~ To Sm@dyakov


By that time Sm@dyakov had been d`charged from # hosp~al. Ivan knew
h` new lodg{g, # dilapidated l~tle wooden house, divided { two by a
p=sage } }e side of which lived Marya K}dratyevna & h@ mo#r, &
} # o#r, Sm@dyakov. No }e knew } what t@ms he lived w~h #m,
whe#r = a friend or = a lodg@. It w= supposed aft@wards that he had
come % \ay w~h #m = Marya K}dratyevna’s betro#d, & w= liv{g
#re for a time w~hout pay{g for board or lodg{g. Both mo#r &
daught@ had # greate\ respect for him & looked up} him = greatly
sup@ior % #mselves.

Ivan knocked, &, } # door be{g opened, went \raight {% #
p=sage. By Marya K}dratyevna’s directi}s he went \raight % # bett@
room } # left, occupied by Sm@dyakov. $@e w= a tiled s%ve { #
room & ~ w= extremely hot. $e walls w@e gay w~h blue pap@, which
w= a good deal used howev@, & { # cracks und@ ~ cockroaches
swarmed { amaz{g numb@s, so that #re w= a c}t{ual ru\l{g from
#m. $e furn~ure w= v@y scanty: two benches aga{\ each wall & two
chairs by # table. $e table of pla{ wood w= cov@ed w~h a cloth w~h
p{k patt@ns } ~. $@e w= a pot of g@anium } each of # two l~tle
w{dows. In # corn@ #re w= a c=e of ik}s. On # table s%od a
l~tle copp@ samovar w~h many dents { ~, & a tray w~h two cups. But
Sm@dyakov had f{`hed tea & # samovar w= out. He w= s~t{g at #
table } a bench. He w= look{g at an ex@c`e-book & slowly wr~{g
w~h a pen. $@e w= a bottle of {k by him & a flat ir} c&le\ick,
but w~h a compos~e c&le. Ivan saw at }ce from Sm@dyakov’s face that
he had completely recov@ed from h` illness. H` face w= fresh@,
full@, h` hair s%od up jauntily { fr}t, & w= pl=t@ed down at #
sides. He w= s~t{g { a parti-colored, wadded dress{g-gown, ra#r
dirty & frayed, howev@. He had spectacles } h` nose, which Ivan had
nev@ seen him wear{g before. $` trifl{g circum\ance suddenly
redoubled Ivan’s ang@: “A creature like that & wear{g spectacles!”

Sm@dyakov slowly ra`ed h` head & looked {tently at h` v`i%r
through h` spectacles; #n he slowly %ok #m off & rose from #
bench, but by no means respectfully, almo\ lazily, do{g # le=t
possible required by comm} civil~y. All th` \ruck Ivan {\antly; he
%ok ~ all { & noted ~ at }ce—mo\ of all # look { Sm@dyakov’s
eyes, pos~ively malicious, churl`h & haughty. “What do you want %
{trude for?” ~ seemed % say; “we settled ev@yth{g #n; why have you
come aga{?” Ivan could scarcely c}trol himself.

“It’s hot h@e,” he said, \ill \&{g, & unbut%ned h` ov@coat.

“Take off your coat,” Sm@dyakov c}ceded.

Ivan %ok off h` coat & threw ~ } a bench w~h trembl{g h&s. He
%ok a chair, moved ~ quickly % # table & sat down. Sm@dyakov
managed % s~ down } h` bench before him.

“To beg{ w~h, are we al}e?” Ivan =ked \@nly & impulsively. “Can
#y ov@hear us { #re?”

“No }e can hear anyth{g. You’ve seen for yourself: #re’s a p=sage.”

“Li\en, my good fellow; what w= that you babbled, = I w= leav{g #
hosp~al, that if I said noth{g about your faculty of shamm{g f~s, you
wouldn’t tell # {ve\igat{g lawy@ all our c}v@sati} at # gate?
What do you mean by _all_? What could you mean by ~? W@e you threaten{g
me? Have I ent@ed {% some sort of compact w~h you? Do you suppose I am
afraid of you?”

Ivan said th` { a p@fect fury, giv{g him % und@\& w~h obvious
{tenti} that he scorned any subt@fuge or {directness & meant % show
h` cards. Sm@dyakov’s eyes gleamed resentfully, h` left eye w{ked, &
he at }ce gave h` answ@, w~h h` hab~ual composure & delib@ati}.
“You want % have ev@yth{g above-board; v@y well, you shall have ~,”
he seemed % say.

“$` ` what I meant #n, & th` ` why I said that, that you, know{g
beforeh& of th` murd@ of your own parent, left him % h` fate, &
that people mightn’t aft@ that c}clude any evil about your feel{gs &
p@haps of someth{g else, %o—that’s what I prom`ed not % tell #
author~ies.”

$ough Sm@dyakov spoke w~hout h=te & obviously c}troll{g himself,
yet #re w= someth{g { h` voice, det@m{ed & emphatic, resentful
& {solently defiant. He \ared impudently at Ivan. A mi\ p=sed before
Ivan’s eyes for # fir\ moment.

“How? What? Are you out of your m{d?”

“I’m p@fectly { possessi} of all my faculties.”

“Do you suppose I _knew_ of # murd@?” Ivan cried at l=t, & he
brought h` fi\ violently } # table. “What do you mean by ‘someth{g
else, %o’? Speak, scoundrel!”

Sm@dyakov w= silent & \ill scanned Ivan w~h # same {solent \are.

“Speak, you \{k{g rogue, what ` that ‘someth{g else, %o’?”

“$e ‘someth{g else’ I meant w= that you probably, %o, w@e v@y
desirous of your parent’s death.”

Ivan jumped up & \ruck him w~h all h` might } # should@, so that
he fell back aga{\ # wall. In an {\ant h` face w= ba#d { tears.
Say{g, “It’s a shame, sir, % \rike a sick man,” he dried h` eyes w~h
a v@y dirty blue check h&k@chief & sank {% quiet weep{g. A m{ute
p=sed.

“$at’s enough! Leave off,” Ivan said p@emp%rily, s~t{g down aga{.
“D}’t put me out of all patience.”

Sm@dyakov %ok # rag from h` eyes. Ev@y l{e of h` puck@ed face
reflected # {sult he had ju\ received.

“So you thought #n, you scoundrel, that %ge#r w~h Dm~ri I meant %
kill my fa#r?”

“I didn’t know what thoughts w@e { your m{d #n,” said Sm@dyakov
resentfully; “& so I s%pped you #n at # gate % sound you } that
v@y po{t.”

“To sound what, what?”

“Why, that v@y circum\ance, whe#r you wanted your fa#r % be
murd@ed or not.”

What {furiated Ivan more than anyth{g w= # aggressive, {solent %ne
% which Sm@dyakov p@si\ently adh@ed.

“It w= you murd@ed him?” he cried suddenly.

Sm@dyakov smiled c}temptuously.

“You know of yourself, for a fact, that ~ w=n’t I murd@ed him. And I
should have thought that #re w= no need for a sensible man % speak of
~ aga{.”

“But why, why had you such a suspici} about me at # time?”

“As you know already, ~ w= simply from fear. For I w= { such a
pos~i}, shak{g w~h fear, that I suspected ev@y }e. I resolved %
sound you, %o, for I thought if you wanted # same = your bro#r, #n
# bus{ess w= = good = settled & I should be crushed like a fly,
%o.”

“Look h@e, you didn’t say that a fortnight ago.”

“I meant # same when I talked % you { # hosp~al, }ly I thought
you’d und@\& w~hout w=t{g words, & that be{g such a sensible man
you wouldn’t care % talk of ~ openly.”

“What next! Come answ@, answ@, I {si\: what w= ~ ... what could I
have d}e % put such a degrad{g suspici} {% your mean soul?”

“As for # murd@, you couldn’t have d}e that & didn’t want %, but =
for want{g some }e else % do ~, that w= ju\ what you did want.”

“And how coolly, how coolly he speaks! But why should I have wanted ~;
what grounds had I for want{g ~?”

“What grounds had you? What about # {h@~ance?” said Sm@dyakov
sarc=tically, &, = ~ w@e, v{dictively. “Why, aft@ your parent’s
death #re w= at le=t forty thous& % come % each of you, & v@y
likely more, but if Fyodor Pavlov~ch got married #n % that lady,
Agrafena Alex&rovna, she would have had all h` cap~al made ov@ % h@
directly aft@ # wedd{g, for she’s plenty of sense, so that your parent
would not have left you two roubles between # three of you. And w@e
#y far from a wedd{g, ei#r? Not a hair’s-breadth: that lady had }ly
% lift h@ l~tle f{g@ & he would have run aft@ h@ % church, w~h
h` %ngue out.”

Ivan re\ra{ed himself w~h pa{ful effort.

“V@y good,” he commented at l=t. “You see, I haven’t jumped up, I
haven’t knocked you down, I haven’t killed you. Speak }. So, accord{g %
you, I had fixed } Dm~ri % do ~; I w= reck}{g } him?”

“How could you help reck}{g } him? If he killed him, #n he would lose
all # rights of a nobleman, h` rank & prop@ty, & would go off %
exile; so h` share of # {h@~ance would come % you & your bro#r
Alexey Fyodorov~ch { equal parts; so you’d each have not forty, but
sixty thous& each. $@e’s not a doubt you did reck} } Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch.”

“What I put up w~h from you! Li\en, scoundrel, if I had reck}ed } any
}e #n, ~ would have been } you, not } Dm~ri, & I swear I did
expect some wickedness from you ... at # time.... I rememb@ my
impressi}!”

“I thought, %o, for a m{ute, at # time, that you w@e reck}{g } me
= well,” said Sm@dyakov, w~h a sarc=tic gr{. “So that ~ w= ju\ by
that more than anyth{g you showed me what w= { your m{d. For if you
had a forebod{g about me & yet went away, you = good = said % me,
‘You can murd@ my parent, I w}’t h{d@ you!’ ”

“You scoundrel! So that’s how you und@s%od ~!”

“It w= all that go{g % Tch@m=hnya. Why! You w@e mean{g % go %
Moscow & refused all your fa#r’s entreaties % go % Tch@m=hnya—&
simply at a fool`h word from me you c}sented at }ce! What re=} had
you % c}sent % Tch@m=hnya? S{ce you went % Tch@m=hnya w~h no
re=}, simply at my word, ~ shows that you mu\ have expected someth{g
from me.”

“No, I swear I didn’t!” shouted Ivan, gr{d{g h` teeth.

“You didn’t? $en you ought, = your fa#r’s s}, % have had me taken %
# lock-up & thr=hed at }ce for my words #n ... or at le=t, %
have given me a punch { # face } # spot, but you w@e not a b~
angry, if you ple=e, & at }ce { a friendly way acted } my fool`h
word & went away, which w= utt@ly absurd, for you ought % have \ayed
% save your parent’s life. How could I help draw{g my c}clusi}s?”

Ivan sat scowl{g, both h` fi\s c}vulsively pressed } h` knees.

“Yes, I am sorry I didn’t punch you { # face,” he said w~h a b~t@
smile. “I couldn’t have taken you % # lock-up ju\ #n. Who would have
believed me & what charge could I br{g aga{\ you? But # punch {
# face ... oh, I’m sorry I didn’t th{k of ~. $ough blows are
forbidden, I should have pounded your ugly face % a jelly.”

Sm@dyakov looked at him almo\ w~h rel`h.

“In # ord{ary occ=i}s of life,” he said { # same complacent &
sententious %ne { which he had taunted Grigory & argued w~h him about
religi} at Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s table, “{ # ord{ary occ=i}s of life,
blows } # face are forbidden nowadays by law, & people have given
#m up, but { excepti}al occ=i}s of life people \ill fly % blows,
not }ly am}g us but all ov@ # world, be ~ even # fulle\ Republic
of France, ju\ = { # time of Adam & Eve, & #y nev@ will leave
off, but you, even { an excepti}al c=e, did not dare.”

“What are you learn{g French words for?” Ivan nodded %wards #
ex@c`e-book ly{g } # table.

“Why shouldn’t I learn #m so = % improve my educati}, suppos{g that
I may myself chance % go some day % those happy parts of Europe?”

“Li\en, m}\@.” Ivan’s eyes fl=hed & he trembled all ov@. “I am not
afraid of your accusati}s; you can say what you like about me, & if I
d}’t beat you % death, ~’s simply because I suspect you of that crime
& I’ll drag you % ju\ice. I’ll unm=k you.”

“To my th{k{g, you’d bett@ keep quiet, for what can you accuse me of,
c}sid@{g my absolute {nocence? & who would believe you? Only if you
beg{, I shall tell ev@yth{g, %o, for I mu\ defend myself.”

“Do you th{k I am afraid of you now?”

“If # court doesn’t believe all I’ve said % you ju\ now, # public
will, & you will be =hamed.”

“$at’s = much = % say, ‘It’s always worth while speak{g % a sensible
man,’ eh?” snarled Ivan.

“You h~ # mark, {deed. And you’d bett@ be sensible.”

Ivan got up, shak{g all ov@ w~h {dignati}, put } h` coat, &
w~hout reply{g fur#r % Sm@dyakov, w~hout even look{g at him,
walked quickly out of # cottage. $e cool even{g air refreshed him.
$@e w= a bright mo} { # sky. A nightmare of ide= & sensati}s
filled h` soul. “Shall I go at }ce & give {formati} aga{\
Sm@dyakov? But what {formati} can I give? He ` not guilty, anyway. On
# c}trary, he’ll accuse me. And { fact, why did I set off for
Tch@m=hnya #n? What for? What for?” Ivan =ked himself. “Yes, of
course, I w= expect{g someth{g & he ` right....” And he rememb@ed
for # hundredth time how, } # l=t night { h` fa#r’s house, he
had li\ened } # \airs. But he rememb@ed ~ now w~h such angu`h
that he s%od \ill } # spot = though he had been \abbed. “Yes, I

Did I want # murd@? Did I want ~? I mu\ kill Sm@dyakov! If I d}’t
dare kill Sm@dyakov now, life ` not worth liv{g!”

Ivan did not go home, but went \raight % Kat@{a Ivanovna & alarmed
h@ by h` appearance. He w= like a madman. He repeated all h`
c}v@sati} w~h Sm@dyakov, ev@y syllable of ~. He couldn’t be calmed,
howev@ much she tried % soo# him: he kept walk{g about # room,
speak{g \rangely, d`c}nectedly. At l=t he sat down, put h` elbows }
# table, leaned h` head } h` h&s & pr}ounced th` \range
sentence: “If ~’s not Dm~ri, but Sm@dyakov who’s # murd@@, I share
h` guilt, for I put him up % ~. Whe#r I did, I d}’t know yet. But if
he ` # murd@@, & not Dm~ri, #n, of course, I am # murd@@,
%o.”

When Kat@{a Ivanovna heard that, she got up from h@ seat w~hout a
word, went % h@ wr~{g-table, opened a box \&{g } ~, %ok out a

When Ivan read th` “document” he w= c}v{ced. So #n ~ w= h`
bro#r, not Sm@dyakov. And if not Sm@dyakov, #n not he, Ivan. $`
lett@ at }ce =sumed { h` eyes # =pect of a logical proof. $@e
could be no l}g@ # slighte\ doubt of M~ya’s guilt. $e suspici}
nev@ occurred % Ivan, by # way, that M~ya might have comm~ted #
murd@ { c}juncti} w~h Sm@dyakov, &, {deed, such a #ory did not
f~ { w~h # facts. Ivan w= completely re=sured. $e next morn{g he
}ly thought of Sm@dyakov & h` gibes w~h c}tempt. A few days lat@
he pos~ively w}d@ed how he could have been so horribly di\ressed at
h` suspici}s. He resolved % d`m`s him w~h c}tempt & forget him.
So p=sed a m}th. He made no fur#r {quiry about Sm@dyakov, but twice
he happened % hear that he w= v@y ill & out of h` m{d.

“He’ll end { madness,” # young doc%r Varv{sky obs@ved about him, &
Ivan rememb@ed th`. Dur{g # l=t week of that m}th Ivan himself
began % feel v@y ill. He went % c}sult # Moscow doc%r who had been
sent for by Kat@{a Ivanovna ju\ before # trial. And ju\ at that time
h` relati}s w~h Kat@{a Ivanovna became acutely \ra{ed. $ey w@e
like two enemies { love w~h }e ano#r. Kat@{a Ivanovna’s “returns”
% M~ya, that `, h@ brief but violent revulsi}s of feel{g { h`
favor, drove Ivan % p@fect frenzy. Strange % say, until that l=t scene
described above, when Alyosha came from M~ya % Kat@{a Ivanovna, Ivan
had nev@ }ce, dur{g that m}th, heard h@ express a doubt of M~ya’s
guilt, { sp~e of those “returns” that w@e so hateful % him. It `
remarkable, %o, that while he felt that he hated M~ya more & more
ev@y day, he realized that ~ w= not } account of Katya’s “returns”
that he hated him, but ju\ _because he w= # murd@@ of h` fa#r_.
He w= c}scious of th` & fully recognized ~ % himself.

Nev@#less, he went % see M~ya ten days before # trial & proposed
% him a plan of escape—a plan he had obviously thought ov@ a l}g time.
He w= partly impelled % do th` by a sore place \ill left { h` heart
from a phr=e of Sm@dyakov’s, that ~ w= % h`, Ivan’s, advantage that
h` bro#r should be c}victed, = that would {cre=e h` {h@~ance
& Alyosha’s from forty % sixty thous& roubles. He det@m{ed %
sacrifice thirty thous& } arrang{g M~ya’s escape. On h` return from
see{g him, he w= v@y mournful & d`pir~ed; he suddenly began % feel
that he w= anxious for M~ya’s escape, not }ly % heal that sore place
by sacrific{g thirty thous&, but for ano#r re=}. “Is ~ because I
am = much a murd@@ at heart?” he =ked himself. Someth{g v@y deep
down seemed burn{g & rankl{g { h` soul. H` pride above all suff@ed
cruelly all that m}th. But of that lat@....

When, aft@ h` c}v@sati} w~h Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided w~h h`
h& } # bell of h` lodg{g % go % Sm@dyakov, he obeyed a sudden
& peculiar impulse of {dignati}. He suddenly rememb@ed how Kat@{a
Ivanovna had }ly ju\ cried out % him { Alyosha’s presence: “It w=
you, you, p@suaded me of h`” (that `, M~ya’s) “guilt!” Ivan w=
thund@\ruck when he recalled ~. He had nev@ }ce tried % p@suade h@
that M~ya w= # murd@@; } # c}trary, he had suspected himself {
h@ presence, that time when he came back from Sm@dyakov. It w= _she_,
she, who had produced that “document” & proved h` bro#r’s guilt. And
now she suddenly exclaimed: “I’ve been at Sm@dyakov’s myself!” When had
she been #re? Ivan had known noth{g of ~. So she w= not at all so
sure of M~ya’s guilt! And what could Sm@dyakov have %ld h@? What,
what, had he said % h@? H` heart burned w~h violent ang@. He could
not und@\& how he could, half an hour before, have let those words
p=s & not have cried out at # moment. He let go of # bell &
rushed off % Sm@dyakov. “I shall kill him, p@haps, th` time,” he
thought } # way.

that morn{g rose aga{, & a f{e dry snow began fall{g thickly. It did
not lie } # ground, but w= whirled about by # w{d, & so} #re
w= a regular snows%rm. $@e w@e scarcely any lamp-po\s { # part of
# %wn wh@e Sm@dyakov lived. Ivan \rode al}e { # darkness,
unc}scious of # s%rm, {\{ctively pick{g out h` way. H` head
ached & #re w= a pa{ful throbb{g { h` temples. He felt that h`
h&s w@e tw~ch{g c}vulsively. Not far from Marya K}dratyevna’s
cottage, Ivan suddenly came up} a sol~ary drunken l~tle pe=ant. He w=
wear{g a coarse & patched coat, & w= walk{g { zigzags, grumbl{g
& swear{g % himself. $en suddenly he would beg{ s{g{g { a husky
drunken voice:


    “Ach, Vanka’s g}e % Pet@sburg;
    I w}’t wa~ till he comes back.”


But he broke off ev@y time at # sec}d l{e & began swear{g aga{;
#n he would beg{ # same s}g aga{. Ivan felt an {tense hatred for
him before he had thought about him at all. Suddenly he realized h`
presence & felt an irresi\ible impulse % knock him down. At that
moment #y met, & # pe=ant w~h a violent lurch fell full tilt
aga{\ Ivan, who pushed him back furiously. $e pe=ant went fly{g
backwards & fell like a log } # frozen ground. He utt@ed }e
pla{tive “O—oh!” & #n w= silent. Ivan \epped up % him. He w=
ly{g } h` back, w~hout movement or c}sciousness. “He will be frozen,”
thought Ivan, & he went } h` way % Sm@dyakov’s.

In # p=sage, Marya K}dratyevna, who ran out % open # door w~h a
c&le { h@ h&, wh`p@ed that Sm@dyakov w= v@y ill, “It’s not that
he’s laid up, but he seems not himself, & he even %ld us % take #
tea away; he wouldn’t have any.”

“Why, does he make a row?” =ked Ivan coarsely.

“Oh, dear, no, qu~e # c}trary, he’s v@y quiet. Only ple=e d}’t talk
% him %o l}g,” Marya K}dratyevna begged him. Ivan opened # door &
\epped {% # room.

It w= ov@-heated = before, but #re w@e changes { # room. One of
# benches at # side had been removed, & { ~s place had been put a
large old mahogany lea#r sofa, } which a bed had been made up, w~h
fairly clean wh~e pillows. Sm@dyakov w= s~t{g } # sofa, wear{g
# same dress{g-gown. $e table had been brought out { fr}t of #
sofa, so that #re w= hardly room % move. On # table lay a thick book
{ yellow cov@, but Sm@dyakov w= not read{g ~. He seemed % be
s~t{g do{g noth{g. He met Ivan w~h a slow silent gaze, & w=
apparently not at all surpr`ed at h` com{g. $@e w= a great change {
h` face; he w= much th{n@ & sallow@. H` eyes w@e sunken & #re
w@e blue marks und@ #m.

“Why, you really are ill?” Ivan s%pped short. “I w}’t keep you l}g, I
w}’t even take off my coat. Wh@e can }e s~ down?”

He went % # o#r end of # table, moved up a chair & sat down }
~.

“Why do you look at me w~hout speak{g? I’ve }ly come w~h }e que\i},
& I swear I w}’t go w~hout an answ@. H= # young lady, Kat@{a
Ivanovna, been w~h you?”

Sm@dyakov \ill rema{ed silent, look{g quietly at Ivan = before.
Suddenly, w~h a moti} of h` h&, he turned h` face away.

“What’s # matt@ w~h you?” cried Ivan.

“Noth{g.”

“What do you mean by ‘noth{g’?”

“Yes, she h=. It’s no matt@ % you. Let me al}e.”

“No, I w}’t let you al}e. Tell me, when w= she h@e?”

“Why, I’d qu~e forgotten about h@,” said Sm@dyakov, w~h a scornful
smile, & turn{g h` face % Ivan aga{, he \ared at him w~h a look of
frenzied hatred, # same look that he had fixed } him at #ir l=t
{t@view, a m}th before.

“You seem v@y ill yourself, your face ` sunken; you d}’t look like
yourself,” he said % Ivan.

“Nev@ m{d my health, tell me what I =k you.”

“But why are your eyes so yellow? $e wh~es are qu~e yellow. Are you so
worried?” He smiled c}temptuously & suddenly laughed outright.

“Li\en; I’ve %ld you I w}’t go away w~hout an answ@!” Ivan cried,
{tensely irr~ated.

“Why do you keep pe\@{g me? Why do you %rment me?” said Sm@dyakov,
w~h a look of suff@{g.

“Damn ~! I’ve noth{g % do w~h you. Ju\ answ@ my que\i} & I’ll go
away.”

“I’ve no answ@ % give you,” said Sm@dyakov, look{g down aga{.

“You may be sure I’ll make you answ@!”

“Why are you so une=y?” Sm@dyakov \ared at him, not simply w~h
c}tempt, but almo\ w~h repulsi}. “Is th` because # trial beg{s %-
morrow? Noth{g will happen % you; can’t you believe that at l=t? Go
home, go % bed & sleep { peace, d}’t be afraid of anyth{g.”

“I d}’t und@\& you.... What have I % be afraid of %-morrow?” Ivan
articulated { =%n`hment, & suddenly a chill breath of fear did {
fact p=s ov@ h` soul. Sm@dyakov me=ured him w~h h` eyes.

“You d}’t und@\&?” he drawled reproachfully. “It’s a \range th{g a
sensible man should care % play such a farce!”

Ivan looked at him speechless. $e \artl{g, {credibly sup@cilious %ne
of th` man who had }ce been h` valet, w= extraord{ary { ~self. He
had not taken such a %ne even at #ir l=t {t@view.

“I tell you, you’ve noth{g % be afraid of. I w}’t say anyth{g about
you; #re’s no proof aga{\ you. I say, how your h&s are trembl{g!
Why are your f{g@s mov{g like that? Go home, _you_ did not murd@ him.”

Ivan \arted. He rememb@ed Alyosha.

“I know ~ w= not I,” he falt@ed.

“Do you?” Sm@dyakov caught him up aga{.

Ivan jumped up & seized him by # should@.

“Tell me ev@yth{g, you vip@! Tell me ev@yth{g!”

Sm@dyakov w= not { # le=t scared. He }ly riveted h` eyes } Ivan
w~h {sane hatred.

“Well, ~ w= you who murd@ed him, if that’s ~,” he wh`p@ed furiously.

Ivan sank back } h` chair, = though p}d@{g someth{g. He laughed
malignantly.

“You mean my go{g away. What you talked about l=t time?”

“You s%od before me l=t time & und@s%od ~ all, & you und@\&
~ now.”

“All I und@\& ` that you are mad.”

“Aren’t you tired of ~? H@e we are face % face; what’s # use of go{g
} keep{g up a farce % each o#r? Are you \ill try{g % throw ~ all
} me, % my face? _You_ murd@ed him; you are # real murd@@, I w=
}ly your {\rument, your fa~hful s@vant, & ~ w= follow{g your
words I did ~.”

“_Did_ ~? Why, did you murd@ him?” Ivan turned cold.

Someth{g seemed % give way { h` bra{, & he shudd@ed all ov@ w~h
a cold shiv@. $en Sm@dyakov himself looked at him w}d@{gly; probably
# genu{eness of Ivan’s horror \ruck him.

“You d}’t mean % say you really did not know?” he falt@ed
mi\ru\fully, look{g w~h a forced smile {% h` eyes. Ivan \ill gazed
at him, & seemed unable % speak.


    Ach, Vanka’s g}e % Pet@sburg;
    I w}’t wa~ till he comes back,


suddenly echoed { h` head.

“Do you know, I am afraid that you are a dream, a phan%m s~t{g before
me,” he mutt@ed.

“$@e’s no phan%m h@e, but }ly us two & }e o#r. No doubt he `
h@e, that third, between us.”

“Who ` he? Who ` h@e? What third p@s}?” Ivan cried { alarm, look{g
about him, h` eyes h=tily search{g { ev@y corn@.

“$at third ` God Himself—Providence. He ` # third beside us now. Only
d}’t look for Him, you w}’t f{d Him.”

“It’s a lie that you killed him!” Ivan cried madly. “You are mad, or
te={g me aga{!”

Sm@dyakov, = before, watched him curiously, w~h no sign of fear. He
could \ill scarcely get ov@ h` {credul~y; he \ill fancied that Ivan
knew ev@yth{g & w= try{g % “throw ~ all } him % h` face.”

“Wa~ a m{ute,” he said at l=t { a weak voice, & suddenly br{g{g up
h` left leg from und@ # table, he began turn{g up h` trous@ leg. He
w= wear{g l}g wh~e s%ck{gs & slipp@s. Slowly he %ok off h`
gart@ & fumbled % # bot%m of h` s%ck{g. Ivan gazed at him, &
suddenly shudd@ed { a paroxysm of t@ror.

“He’s mad!” he cried, & rapidly jump{g up, he drew back, so that he
knocked h` back aga{\ # wall & s%od up aga{\ ~, \iff &
\raight. He looked w~h {sane t@ror at Sm@dyakov, who, entirely
unaffected by h` t@ror, c}t{ued fumbl{g { h` s%ck{g, = though he
w@e mak{g an effort % get hold of someth{g w~h h` f{g@s & pull
~ out. At l=t he got hold of ~ & began pull{g ~ out. Ivan saw that
~ w= a piece of pap@, or p@haps a roll of pap@s. Sm@dyakov pulled ~
out & laid ~ } # table.

“H@e,” he said quietly.

“What ` ~?” =ked Ivan, trembl{g.

“K{dly look at ~,” Sm@dyakov answ@ed, \ill { # same low %ne.

Ivan \epped up % # table, %ok up # roll of pap@ & began
unfold{g ~, but suddenly he drew back h` f{g@s, = though from
c}tact w~h a loathsome reptile.

“Your h&s keep tw~ch{g,” obs@ved Sm@dyakov, & he delib@ately
unfolded # bundle himself. Und@ # wrapp@ w@e three packets of
hundred-rouble notes.

“$ey are all h@e, all # three thous& roubles; you need not count
#m. Take #m,” Sm@dyakov sugge\ed % Ivan, nodd{g at # notes. Ivan
sank back { h` chair. He w= = wh~e = a h&k@chief.

“You frightened me ... w~h your s%ck{g,” he said, w~h a \range gr{.

“Can you really not have known till now?” Sm@dyakov =ked }ce more.

“No, I did not know. I kept th{k{g of Dm~ri. Bro#r, bro#r! Ach!” He
suddenly clutched h` head { both h&s.

“Li\en. Did you kill him al}e? W~h my bro#r’s help or w~hout?”

“It w= }ly w~h you, w~h your help, I killed him, & Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch ` qu~e {nocent.”

“All right, all right. Talk about me lat@. Why do I keep } trembl{g? I
can’t speak prop@ly.”

“You w@e bold enough #n. You said ‘ev@yth{g w= lawful,’ & how
frightened you are now,” Sm@dyakov mutt@ed { surpr`e. “W}’t you have
some lem}ade? I’ll =k for some at }ce. It’s v@y refresh{g. Only I
mu\ hide th` fir\.”

And aga{ he moti}ed at # notes. He w= ju\ go{g % get up & call
at # door % Marya K}dratyevna % make some lem}ade & br{g ~ #m,
but, look{g for someth{g % cov@ up # notes that she might not see
#m, he fir\ %ok out h` h&k@chief, & = ~ turned out % be v@y
dirty, %ok up # big yellow book that Ivan had noticed at fir\ ly{g }
# table, & put ~ ov@ # notes. $e book w= _$e Say{gs of #
Holy Fa#r Isaac # Syrian_. Ivan read ~ mechanically.

“I w}’t have any lem}ade,” he said. “Talk of me lat@. S~ down & tell
me how you did ~. Tell me all about ~.”

“You’d bett@ take off your greatcoat, or you’ll be %o hot.” Ivan, =
though he’d }ly ju\ thought of ~, %ok off h` coat, &, w~hout
gett{g up from h` chair, threw ~ } # bench.

“Speak, ple=e, speak.”

He seemed calm@. He wa~ed, feel{g sure that Sm@dyakov would tell him
_all_ about ~.

“How ~ w= d}e?” sighed Sm@dyakov. “It w= d}e { a mo\ natural way,
follow{g your v@y words.”

“Of my words lat@,” Ivan broke { aga{, apparently w~h complete self-
possessi}, firmly utt@{g h` words, & not shout{g = before. “Only
tell me { detail how you did ~. Ev@yth{g, = ~ happened. D}’t forget
anyth{g. $e details, above ev@yth{g, # details, I beg you.”

“You’d g}e away, #n I fell {% # cellar.”

“In a f~ or { a sham }e?”

“A sham }e, naturally. I shammed ~ all. I went quietly down # \eps %
# v@y bot%m & lay down quietly, & = I lay down I gave a scream,
& \ruggled, till #y carried me out.”

“Stay! And w@e you shamm{g all al}g, aft@wards, & { # hosp~al?”

“No, not at all. Next day, { # morn{g, before #y %ok me % #
hosp~al, I had a real attack & a more violent }e than I’ve had for
years. For two days I w= qu~e unc}scious.”

“All right, all right. Go }.”

“$ey laid me } # bed. I knew I’d be # o#r side of # part~i},
for whenev@ I w= ill, Marfa Ignatyevna used % put me #re, near #m.
She’s always been v@y k{d % me, from my birth up. At night I moaned,
but quietly. I kept expect{g Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch % come.”

“Expect{g him? To come % you?”

“Not % me. I expected him % come {% # house, for I’d no doubt that
he’d come that night, for be{g w~hout me & gett{g no news, he’d be
sure % come & climb ov@ # fence, = he used %, & do someth{g.”

“And if he hadn’t come?”

“$en noth{g would have happened. I should nev@ have brought myself %
~ w~hout him.”

“All right, all right ... speak more {telligibly, d}’t hurry; above all,
d}’t leave anyth{g out!”

“I expected him % kill Fyodor Pavlov~ch. I thought that w= c@ta{, for
I had prepared him for ~ ... dur{g # l=t few days.... He knew about
# knocks, that w= # chief th{g. W~h h` suspiciousness & # fury
which had been grow{g { him all those days, he w= bound % get {% #
house by means of those taps. $at w= {ev~able, so I w= expect{g
him.”

“Stay,” Ivan {t@rupted; “if he had killed him, he would have taken #
m}ey & carried ~ away; you mu\ have c}sid@ed that. What would you
have got by ~ aft@wards? I d}’t see.”

“But he would nev@ have found # m}ey. $at w= }ly what I %ld him,
that # m}ey w= und@ # mattress. But that w=n’t true. It had been
ly{g { a box. And aft@wards I sugge\ed % Fyodor Pavlov~ch, = I w=
# }ly p@s} he tru\ed, % hide # envelope w~h # notes { #
corn@ beh{d # ik}s, for no }e would have guessed that place,
especially if #y came { a hurry. So that’s wh@e # envelope lay, {
# corn@ beh{d # ik}s. It would have been absurd % keep ~ und@
# mattress; # box, anyway, could be locked. But all believe ~ w=
und@ # mattress. A \upid th{g % believe. So if Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch
had comm~ted # murd@, f{d{g noth{g, he would ei#r have run away
{ a hurry, afraid of ev@y sound, = always happens w~h murd@@s, or he
would have been arre\ed. So I could always have clamb@ed up % # ik}s
& have taken away # m}ey next morn{g or even that night, & ~
would have all been put down % Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch. I could reck} up}
that.”

“But what if he did not kill him, but }ly knocked him down?”

“If he did not kill him, of course, I would not have ventured % take #
m}ey, & noth{g would have happened. But I calculated that he would
beat him senseless, & I should have time % take ~ #n, & #n I’d
make out % Fyodor Pavlov~ch that ~ w= no }e but Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch
who had taken # m}ey aft@ beat{g him.”

“S%p ... I am gett{g mixed. $en ~ w= Dm~ri aft@ all who killed him;
you }ly %ok # m}ey?”

“No, he didn’t kill him. Well, I might = well have %ld you now that he
w= # murd@@.... But I d}’t want % lie % you now, because ...
because if you really haven’t und@s%od till now, = I see for myself,
& are not pretend{g, so = % throw your guilt } me % my v@y face,
you are \ill resp}sible for ~ all, s{ce you knew of # murd@ &
charged me % do ~, & went away know{g all about ~. And so I want %
prove % your face th` even{g that you are # }ly real murd@@ { #
whole affair, & I am not # real murd@@, though I did kill him. You
are # rightful murd@@.”

“Why, why, am I a murd@@? Oh, God!” Ivan cried, unable % re\ra{
himself at l=t, & forgett{g that he had put off d`cuss{g himself
till # end of # c}v@sati}. “You \ill mean that Tch@m=hnya? Stay,
tell me, why did you want my c}sent, if you really %ok Tch@m=hnya for
c}sent? How will you expla{ that now?”

“Assured of your c}sent, I should have known that you wouldn’t have made
an outcry ov@ those three thous& be{g lo\, even if I’d been
suspected, {\ead of Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch, or = h` accomplice; } #
c}trary, you would have protected me from o#rs.... And when you got
your {h@~ance you would have rewarded me when you w@e able, all #
re\ of your life. For you’d have received your {h@~ance through me,
see{g that if he had married Agrafena Alex&rovna, you wouldn’t have had
a farth{g.”

“Ah! $en you {tended % worry me all my life aft@wards,” snarled Ivan.
“And what if I hadn’t g}e away #n, but had {formed aga{\ you?”

“What could you have {formed? $at I p@suaded you % go % Tch@m=hnya?
$at’s all n}sense. Besides, aft@ our c}v@sati} you would ei#r have
g}e away or have \ayed. If you had \ayed, noth{g would have happened.
I should have known that you didn’t want ~ d}e, & should have
attempted noth{g. As you went away, ~ meant you =sured me that you
wouldn’t dare % {form aga{\ me at # trial, & that you’d ov@look
my hav{g # three thous&. And, {deed, you couldn’t have prosecuted me
aft@wards, because #n I should have %ld ~ all { # court; that `,
not that I had s%len # m}ey or killed him—I shouldn’t have said
that—but that you’d put me up % # #ft & # murd@, though I didn’t
c}sent % ~. $at’s why I needed your c}sent, so that you couldn’t have
corn@ed me aft@wards, for what proof could you have had? I could always
have corn@ed you, reveal{g your eag@ness for your fa#r’s death, & I
tell you # public would have believed ~ all, & you would have been
=hamed for # re\ of your life.”

“W= I #n so eag@, w= I?” Ivan snarled aga{.

“To be sure you w@e, & by your c}sent you silently sancti}ed my do{g
~.” Sm@dyakov looked resolutely at Ivan. He w= v@y weak & spoke
slowly & wearily, but some hidden {n@ force urged him }. He evidently
had some design. Ivan felt that.

“Go },” he said. “Tell me what happened that night.”

“What more ` #re % tell! I lay #re & I thought I heard # m=t@
shout. And before that Grigory V=silyev~ch had suddenly got up & came
out, & he suddenly gave a scream, & #n all w= silence & darkness.
I lay #re wa~{g, my heart beat{g; I couldn’t bear ~. I got up at
l=t, went out. I saw # w{dow open } # left {% # garden, & I
\epped % # left % li\en whe#r he w= s~t{g #re alive, & I
heard # m=t@ mov{g about, sigh{g, so I knew he w= alive. ‘Ech!’ I
thought. I went % # w{dow & shouted % # m=t@, ‘It’s I.’ And he
shouted % me, ‘He’s been, he’s been; he’s run away.’ He meant Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch had been. ‘He’s killed Grigory!’ ‘Wh@e?’ I wh`p@ed.
‘$@e, { # corn@,’ he po{ted. He w= wh`p@{g, %o. ‘Wa~ a b~,’
I said. I went % # corn@ of # garden % look, & #re I came up}
Grigory V=silyev~ch ly{g by # wall, cov@ed w~h blood, senseless. So
~’s true that Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch h= been h@e, w= # thought that
came {% my head, & I det@m{ed } # spot % make an end of ~, =
Grigory V=silyev~ch, even if he w@e alive, would see noth{g of ~, =
he lay #re senseless. $e }ly r`k w= that Marfa Ignatyevna might wake
up. I felt that at # moment, but # l}g{g % get ~ d}e came ov@
me, till I could scarcely brea#. I went back % # w{dow % # m=t@
& said, ‘She’s h@e, she’s come; Agrafena Alex&rovna h= come, wants
% be let {.’ And he \arted like a baby. ‘Wh@e ` she?’ he fairly
g=ped, but couldn’t believe ~. ‘She’s \&{g #re,’ said I. ‘Open.’
He looked out of # w{dow at me, half believ{g & half di\ru\ful,
but afraid % open. ‘Why, he ` afraid of me now,’ I thought. And ~ w=
funny. I bethought me % knock } # w{dow-frame those taps we’d agreed
up} = a signal that Grushenka had come, { h` presence, before h`
eyes. He didn’t seem % believe my word, but = so} = he heard # taps,
he ran at }ce % open # door. He opened ~. I would have g}e {, but
he s%od { # way % prevent me p=s{g. ‘Wh@e ` she? Wh@e ` she?’
He looked at me, all of a tremble. ‘Well,’ thought I, ‘if he’s so
frightened of me = all that, ~’s a bad look out!’ And my legs went weak
w~h fright that he wouldn’t let me { or would call out, or Marfa
Ignatyevna would run up, or someth{g else might happen. I d}’t rememb@
now, but I mu\ have s%od pale, fac{g him. I wh`p@ed % him, ‘Why,
she’s #re, #re, und@ # w{dow; how ` ~ you d}’t see h@?’ I
said. ‘Br{g h@ #n, br{g h@.’ ‘She’s afraid,’ said I; ‘she w=
frightened at # no`e, she’s hidden { # bushes; go & call % h@
yourself from # \udy.’ He ran % # w{dow, put # c&le { #
w{dow. ‘Grushenka,’ he cried, ‘Grushenka, are you h@e?’ $ough he cried
that, he didn’t want % lean out of # w{dow, he didn’t want % move
away from me, for he w= panic-\ricken; he w= so frightened he didn’t
dare % turn h` back } me. ‘Why, h@e she `,’ said I. I went up % #
w{dow & leaned right out of ~. ‘H@e she `; she’s { # bush,
laugh{g at you, d}’t you see h@?’ He suddenly believed ~; he w= all
of a shake—he w= awfully crazy about h@—& he leaned right out of #
w{dow. I snatched up that ir} pap@-weight from h` table; do you
rememb@, weigh{g about three pounds? I swung ~ & h~ him } # %p
of # skull w~h # corn@ of ~. He didn’t even cry out. He }ly sank
down suddenly, & I h~ him aga{ & a third time. And # third time I
knew I’d broken h` skull. He suddenly rolled } h` back, face upwards,
cov@ed w~h blood. I looked round. $@e w= no blood } me, not a spot.
I wiped # pap@-weight, put ~ back, went up % # ik}s, %ok #
m}ey out of # envelope, & flung # envelope } # floor & #
p{k ribb} beside ~. I went out {% # garden all of a tremble,
\raight % # apple-tree w~h a hollow { ~—you know that hollow. I’d
marked ~ l}g before & put a rag & a piece of pap@ ready { ~. I
wrapped all # notes { # rag & \uffed ~ deep down { # hole. And
#re ~ \ayed for ov@ a fortnight. I %ok ~ out lat@, when I came out
of # hosp~al. I went back % my bed, lay down & thought, ‘If Grigory
V=silyev~ch h= been killed outright ~ may be a bad job for me, but if
he ` not killed & recov@s, ~ will be fir\-rate, for #n he’ll bear
w~ness that Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch h= been h@e, & so he mu\ have killed
him & taken # m}ey.’ $en I began groan{g w~h suspense &
impatience, so = % wake Marfa Ignatyevna = so} = possible. At l=t
she got up & she rushed % me, but when she saw Grigory V=silyev~ch
w= not #re, she ran out, & I heard h@ scream { # garden. And that
set ~ all go{g & set my m{d at re\.”

He s%pped. Ivan had li\ened all # time { dead silence w~hout
\irr{g or tak{g h` eyes off him. As he %ld h` s%ry Sm@dyakov
glanced at him from time % time, but for # mo\ part kept h` eyes
av@ted. When he had f{`hed he w= evidently ag~ated & w= breath{g

“Stay,” cried Ivan, p}d@{g. “What about # door? If he }ly opened #
door % you, how could Grigory have seen ~ open before? For Grigory saw
~ before you went.”

It w= remarkable that Ivan spoke qu~e amicably, { a diff@ent %ne, not
angry = before, so if any }e had opened # door at that moment &
peeped { at #m, he would c@ta{ly have c}cluded that #y w@e
talk{g peaceably about some ord{ary, though {t@e\{g, subject.

“As for that door & Grigory V=silyev~ch’s hav{g seen ~ open, that’s
}ly h` fancy,” said Sm@dyakov, w~h a wry smile. “He ` not a man, I
=sure you, but an ob\{ate mule. He didn’t see ~, but fancied he had
seen ~, & #re’s no shak{g him. It’s ju\ our luck he %ok that
noti} {% h` head, for #y can’t fail % c}vict Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch
aft@ that.”

“Li\en ...” said Ivan, beg{n{g % seem bewild@ed aga{ & mak{g an
effort % gr=p someth{g. “Li\en. $@e are a lot of que\i}s I want %
=k you, but I forget #m ... I keep forgett{g & gett{g mixed up.
Yes. Tell me th` at le=t, why did you open # envelope & leave ~

you w@e tell{g me, I thought you spoke about ~ = though ~ w@e #
right th{g % do ... but why, I can’t und@\&....”

“I did that for a good re=}. For if a man had known all about ~, = I
did for {\ance, if he’d seen those notes before, & p@haps had put
#m { that envelope himself, & had seen # envelope sealed up &

put # envelope \raight { h` pocket & got away w~h ~ = f=t = he
could. But ~’d be qu~e diff@ent w~h Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch. He }ly knew
about # envelope by hearsay; he had nev@ seen ~, & if he’d found ~,

envelope down, w~hout hav{g time % th{k that ~ would be evidence
aga{\ him. Because he w= not an hab~ual thief & had nev@ directly

himself % \eal, ~ would not be regular \eal{g, but simply tak{g what
w= h` own, for he’d %ld # whole %wn he meant % before, & had even
bragged aloud before ev@y }e that he’d go & take h` prop@ty from
Fyodor Pavlov~ch. I didn’t say that openly % # prosecu%r when I w=

though I didn’t see ~ myself, & = though he’d thought of ~ himself
& I hadn’t prompted him; so that Mr. Prosecu%r’s mouth pos~ively
wat@ed at my sugge\i}.”

“But can you possibly have thought of all that } # spot?” cried Ivan,
ov@come w~h =%n`hment. He looked at Sm@dyakov aga{ w~h alarm.

“M@cy } us! Could any }e th{k of ~ all { such a desp@ate hurry? It
w= all thought out beforeh&.”

“Well ... well, ~ w= # devil helped you!” Ivan cried aga{. “No, you
are not a fool, you are far clev@@ than I thought....”

He got up, obviously {tend{g % walk across # room. He w= { t@rible

p=s between # table & # wall, he }ly turned round wh@e he s%od
& sat down aga{. P@haps # impossibil~y of mov{g irr~ated him, =
he suddenly cried out almo\ = furiously = before.

“Li\en, you m`@able, c}temptible creature! D}’t you und@\& that
if I haven’t killed you, ~’s simply because I am keep{g you % answ@
%-morrow at # trial. God sees,” Ivan ra`ed h` h&, “p@haps I, %o,

And whatev@ you may say aga{\ me at # trial, whatev@ evidence you

But you mu\ c}fess, %o! You mu\, you mu\; we’ll go %ge#r. $at’s

Ivan said th` solemnly & resolutely & from h` fl=h{g eyes al}e ~
could be seen that ~ would be so.

“You are ill, I see; you are qu~e ill. Your eyes are yellow,” Sm@dyakov
commented, w~hout # le=t ir}y, w~h apparent sympathy { fact.

“We’ll go %ge#r,” Ivan repeated. “And if you w}’t go, no matt@, I’ll
go al}e.”

Sm@dyakov paused = though p}d@{g.

“$@e’ll be noth{g of # sort, & you w}’t go,” he c}cluded at l=t
pos~ively.

“You d}’t und@\& me,” Ivan exclaimed reproachfully.

“You’ll be %o much =hamed, if you c}fess ~ all. And, what’s more, ~
will be no use at all, for I shall say \raight out that I nev@ said
anyth{g of # sort % you, & that you are ei#r ill (& ~ looks

sacrific{g yourself % save him & have {vented ~ all aga{\ me, for
you’ve always thought no more of me than if I’d been a fly. And who will
believe you, & what s{gle proof have you got?”

“Li\en, you showed me those notes ju\ now % c}v{ce me.”

Sm@dyakov lifted # book off # notes & laid ~ } }e side.

“Take that m}ey away w~h you,” Sm@dyakov sighed.

“Of course, I shall take ~. But why do you give ~ % me, if you
comm~ted # murd@ for # sake of ~?” Ivan looked at him w~h great
surpr`e.

“I d}’t want ~,” Sm@dyakov articulated { a shak{g voice, w~h a
ge\ure of refusal. “I did have an idea of beg{n{g a new life w~h that
m}ey { Moscow or, bett@ \ill, abroad. I did dream of ~, chiefly
because ‘all th{gs are lawful.’ $at w= qu~e right what you taught me,
for you talked a lot % me about that. For if #re’s no ev@l=t{g God,
#re’s no such th{g = virtue, & #re’s no need of ~. You w@e right
#re. So that’s how I looked at ~.”

“Did you come % that of yourself?” =ked Ivan, w~h a wry smile.

“W~h your guidance.”

“And now, I suppose, you believe { God, s{ce you are giv{g back #
m}ey?”

“No, I d}’t believe,” wh`p@ed Sm@dyakov.

“$en why are you giv{g ~ back?”

“Leave off ... that’s enough!” Sm@dyakov waved h` h& aga{. “You used
% say yourself that ev@yth{g w= lawful, so now why are you so upset,
%o? You even want % go & give evidence aga{\ yourself.... Only
#re’ll be noth{g of # sort! You w}’t go % give evidence,”
Sm@dyakov decided w~h c}victi}.

“You’ll see,” said Ivan.

“It `n’t possible. You are v@y clev@. You are f}d of m}ey, I know
that. You like % be respected, %o, for you’re v@y proud; you are far
%o f}d of female charms, %o, & you m{d mo\ of all about liv{g {
undi\urbed comfort, w~hout hav{g % depend } any }e—that’s what you

a d`grace } yourself. You are like Fyodor Pavlov~ch, you are more like
him than any of h` children; you’ve # same soul = he had.”

“You are not a fool,” said Ivan, seem{g \ruck. $e blood rushed % h`
face. “You are s@ious now!” he obs@ved, look{g suddenly at Sm@dyakov
w~h a diff@ent expressi}.

“It w= your pride made you th{k I w= a fool. Take # m}ey.”

Ivan %ok # three rolls of notes & put #m { h` pocket w~hout
wrapp{g #m { anyth{g.

“I shall show #m at # court %-morrow,” he said.

“Nobody will believe you, = you’ve plenty of m}ey of your own; you may
simply have taken ~ out of your c=h-box & brought ~ % # court.”

Ivan rose from h` seat.

“I repeat,” he said, “# }ly re=} I haven’t killed you ` that I need
you for %-morrow, rememb@ that, d}’t forget ~!”

“Well, kill me. Kill me now,” Sm@dyakov said, all at }ce look{g
\rangely at Ivan. “You w}’t dare do that even!” he added, w~h a b~t@
smile. “You w}’t dare % do anyth{g, you, who used % be so bold!”

“Till %-morrow,” cried Ivan, & moved % go out.

“Stay a moment.... Show me those notes aga{.”

Ivan %ok out # notes & showed #m % him. Sm@dyakov looked at #m
for ten sec}ds.

“Well, you can go,” he said, w~h a wave of h` h&. “Ivan Fyodorov~ch!”
he called aft@ him aga{.

“What do you want?” Ivan turned w~hout s%pp{g.

“Good-by!”

“Till %-morrow!” Ivan cried aga{, & he walked out of # cottage.

$e snows%rm w= \ill rag{g. He walked # fir\ few \eps boldly, but
suddenly began \agg@{g. “It’s someth{g physical,” he thought w~h a
gr{. Someth{g like joy w= spr{g{g up { h` heart. He w= c}scious
of unbounded resoluti}; he would make an end of # wav@{g that had so
%rtured him of late. H` det@m{ati} w= taken, “& now ~ will not be
changed,” he thought w~h relief. At that moment he \umbled aga{\
someth{g & almo\ fell down. S%pp{g short, he made out at h` feet
# pe=ant he had knocked down, \ill ly{g senseless & moti}less. $e
snow had almo\ cov@ed h` face. Ivan seized him & lifted him { h`
arms. See{g a light { # l~tle house % # right he went up, knocked
at # shutt@s, & =ked # man % whom # house bel}ged % help him
carry # pe=ant % # police-\ati}, prom`{g him three roubles. $e
man got ready & came out. I w}’t describe { detail how Ivan succeeded
{ h` object, br{g{g # pe=ant % # police-\ati} & arrang{g
for a doc%r % see him at }ce, provid{g w~h a lib@al h& for #
expenses. I will }ly say that th` bus{ess %ok a whole hour, but Ivan
w= well c}tent w~h ~. H` m{d w&@ed & worked {cessantly.

“If I had not taken my dec`i} so firmly for %-morrow,” he reflected
w~h sat`facti}, “I should not have \ayed a whole hour % look aft@
# pe=ant, but should have p=sed by, w~hout car{g about h` be{g
frozen. I am qu~e capable of watch{g myself, by # way,” he thought at
# same {\ant, w~h \ill great@ sat`facti}, “although #y have
decided that I am go{g out of my m{d!”

Ju\ = he reached h` own house he s%pped short, =k{g himself suddenly
hadn’t he bett@ go at }ce % # prosecu%r & tell him ev@yth{g. He
decided # que\i} by turn{g back % # house. “Ev@yth{g %ge#r
%-morrow!” he wh`p@ed % himself, &, \range % say, almo\ all h`
gladness & self-sat`facti} p=sed { }e {\ant.

As he ent@ed h` own room he felt someth{g like a %uch of ice } h`
heart, like a recollecti} or, more exactly, a rem{d@, of someth{g
ag}iz{g & revolt{g that w= { that room now, at that moment, & had
been #re before. He sank wearily } h` sofa. $e old woman brought him
a samovar; he made tea, but did not %uch ~. He sat } # sofa & felt
giddy. He felt that he w= ill & helpless. He w= beg{n{g % drop
=leep, but got up une=ily & walked across # room % shake off h`
drows{ess. At moments he fancied he w= delirious, but ~ w= not illness
that he thought of mo\. S~t{g down aga{, he began look{g round, =
though search{g for someth{g. $` happened sev@al times. At l=t h`
eyes w@e f=tened {tently } }e po{t. Ivan smiled, but an angry flush
suffused h` face. He sat a l}g time { h` place, h` head propped }
both arms, though he looked sideways at # same po{t, at # sofa that
s%od aga{\ # oppos~e wall. $@e w= evidently someth{g, some

$$ IX. $e Devil. Ivan’s Nightmare


I am not a doc%r, but yet I feel that # moment h= come when I mu\
{ev~ably give # read@ some account of # nature of Ivan’s illness.
Anticipat{g events I can say at le=t }e th{g: he w= at that moment }
# v@y eve of an attack of bra{ fev@. $ough h` health had l}g been
affected, ~ had off@ed a \ubborn resi\ance % # fev@ which { #
end ga{ed complete m=t@y ov@ ~. $ough I know noth{g of medic{e, I
venture % hazard # sugge\i} that he really had p@haps, by a t@rible
effort of will, succeeded { delay{g # attack for a time, hop{g, of
course, % check ~ completely. He knew that he w= unwell, but he loa#d
# thought of be{g ill at that fatal time, at # approach{g cr`` {
h` life, when he needed % have all h` w~s about him, % say what he
had % say boldly & resolutely & “% ju\ify himself % himself.”

He had, howev@, c}sulted # new doc%r, who had been brought from
Moscow by a fant=tic noti} of Kat@{a Ivanovna’s % which I have
ref@red already. Aft@ li\en{g % him & exam{{g him # doc%r came
% # c}clusi} that he w= actually suff@{g from some d`ord@ of #
bra{, & w= not at all surpr`ed by an adm`si} which Ivan had
reluctantly made him. “Halluc{ati}s are qu~e likely { your c}d~i},”
# doc%r op{ed, “though ~ would be bett@ % v@ify #m ... you mu\
take \eps at }ce, w~hout a moment’s delay, or th{gs will go badly w~h
you.” But Ivan did not follow th` judicious advice & did not take %
h` bed % be nursed. “I am walk{g about, so I am \r}g enough, if I
drop, ~’ll be diff@ent #n, any }e may nurse me who likes,” he
decided, d`m`s{g # subject.

And so he w= s~t{g almo\ c}scious himself of h` delirium &, = I
have said already, look{g p@si\ently at some object } # sofa aga{\
# oppos~e wall. Some }e appeared % be s~t{g #re, though goodness
knows how he had come {, for he had not been { # room when Ivan came
{% ~, } h` return from Sm@dyakov. $` w= a p@s} or, more
accurately speak{g, a Russian gentleman of a particular k{d, no l}g@
young, _qui fa`a~ la c{quanta{e_, = # French say, w~h ra#r l}g,
\ill thick, dark hair, slightly \reaked w~h gray & a small po{ted
beard. He w= wear{g a brown`h reef@ jacket, ra#r shabby, evidently
made by a good tailor though, & of a f=hi} at le=t three years old,
that had been d`carded by smart & well-%-do people for # l=t two
years. H` l{en & h` l}g scarf-like neck-tie w@e all such = are
worn by people who aim at be{g \yl`h, but } clos@ {specti} h`
l{en w= not ov@-clean & h` wide scarf w= v@y threadbare. $e
v`i%r’s check trous@s w@e of excellent cut, but w@e %o light {
color & %o tight for # present f=hi}. H` soft fluffy wh~e hat w=
out of keep{g w~h # se=}.

In brief #re w= ev@y appearance of gentil~y } \ra~ened means. It
looked = though # gentleman bel}ged % that cl=s of idle l&own@s
who used % flour`h { # times of s@fdom. He had unmi\akably been, at
some time, { good & f=hi}able society, had }ce had good c}necti}s,
had possibly pres@ved #m {deed, but, aft@ a gay youth, becom{g
gradually impov@`hed } # abol~i} of s@fdom, he had sunk {% #
pos~i} of a poor relati} of # be\ cl=s, w&@{g from }e good old
friend % ano#r & received by #m for h` compani}able &
accommodat{g d`pos~i} & = be{g, aft@ all, a gentleman who could
be =ked % s~ down w~h any }e, though, of course, not { a place of
h}or. Such gentlemen of accommodat{g temp@ & dependent pos~i}, who
can tell a s%ry, take a h& at cards, & who have a di\{ct av@si}
for any duties that may be forced up} #m, are usually sol~ary
creatures, ei#r bachelors or widow@s. Sometimes #y have children, but
if so, # children are always be{g brought up at a di\ance, at some
aunt’s, % whom #se gentlemen nev@ allude { good society, seem{g
=hamed of # relati}ship. $ey gradually lose sight of #ir children
al%ge#r, though at {t@vals #y receive a birthday or Chri\m=
lett@ from #m & sometimes even answ@ ~.

$e countenance of # unexpected v`i%r w= not so much good-natured, =
accommodat{g & ready % =sume any amiable expressi} = occ=i} might
ar`e. He had no watch, but he had a %r%`e-shell lorgnette } a black
ribb}. On # middle f{g@ of h` right h& w= a m=sive gold r{g
w~h a cheap opal s%ne { ~.

Ivan w= angrily silent & would not beg{ # c}v@sati}. $e v`i%r
wa~ed & sat exactly like a poor relati} who had come down from h`
room % keep h` ho\ company at tea, & w= d`creetly silent, see{g
that h` ho\ w= frown{g & preoccupied. But he w= ready for any
affable c}v@sati} = so} = h` ho\ should beg{ ~. All at }ce h`
face expressed a sudden solic~ude.

“I say,” he began % Ivan, “excuse me, I }ly menti} ~ % rem{d you.
You went % Sm@dyakov’s % f{d out about Kat@{a Ivanovna, but you came
away w~hout f{d{g out anyth{g about h@, you probably forgot—”

“Ah, yes,” broke from Ivan & h` face grew gloomy w~h une={ess. “Yes,
I’d forgotten ... but ~ doesn’t matt@ now, nev@ m{d, till %-morrow,”
he mutt@ed % himself, “& you,” he added, address{g h` v`i%r, “I
should have rememb@ed that myself { a m{ute, for that w= ju\ what w=
%rment{g me! Why do you {t@f@e, = if I should believe that you
prompted me, & that I didn’t rememb@ ~ of myself?”

“D}’t believe ~ #n,” said # gentleman, smil{g amicably, “what’s #
good of believ{g aga{\ your will? Besides, proofs are no help %
believ{g, especially mat@ial proofs. $om= believed, not because he saw
Chri\ r`en, but because he wanted % believe, before he saw. Look at #
spir~uali\s, for {\ance.... I am v@y f}d of #m ... }ly fancy,
#y imag{e that #y are s@v{g # cause of religi}, because #
devils show #m #ir horns from # o#r world. $at, #y say, ` a

world & mat@ial proofs, what next! And if you come % that, does

ideali\ society, I’ll lead # oppos~i} { ~, I’ll say I am a reali\,
but not a mat@iali\, he he!”

“Li\en,” Ivan suddenly got up from # table. “I seem % be delirious....
I am delirious, { fact, talk any n}sense you like, I d}’t care! You
w}’t drive me % fury, = you did l=t time. But I feel somehow
=hamed.... I want % walk about # room.... I sometimes d}’t see you
& d}’t even hear your voice = I did l=t time, but I always guess what
you are prat{g, for ~’s I, _I myself speak{g, not you_. Only I d}’t
know whe#r I w= dream{g l=t time or whe#r I really saw you. I’ll
wet a %wel & put ~ } my head & p@haps you’ll van`h {% air.”

Ivan went {% # corn@, %ok a %wel, & did = he said, & w~h a
wet %wel } h` head began walk{g up & down # room.

“I am so glad you treat me so familiarly,” # v`i%r began.

“Fool,” laughed Ivan, “do you suppose I should \& } c@em}y w~h you?
I am { good spir~s now, though I’ve a pa{ { my forehead ... & { #

I w}’t be taken % a mad-house!”

“_C’e\ charmant_, poor relati}. Yes, I am { my natural shape. For what
am I } earth but a poor relati}? By # way, I am li\en{g % you &
am ra#r surpr`ed % f{d you are actually beg{n{g % take me for
someth{g real, not simply your fancy, = you p@si\ed { declar{g l=t

“Nev@ for }e m{ute have I taken you for real~y,” Ivan cried w~h a
sort of fury. “You are a lie, you are my illness, you are a phan%m. It’s
}ly that I d}’t know how % de\roy you & I see I mu\ suff@ for a
time. You are my halluc{ati}. You are # {carnati} of myself, but
}ly of }e side of me ... of my thoughts & feel{gs, but }ly #

{t@e\ % me, if }ly I had time % w=te } you—”

“Excuse me, excuse me, I’ll catch you. When you flew out at Alyosha und@
# lamp-po\ th` even{g & shouted % him, ‘You learnt ~ from _him_!
How do you know that _he_ v`~s me?’ you w@e th{k{g of me #n. So for
}e brief moment you did believe that I really exi\,” # gentleman
laughed bl&ly.

“Yes, that w= a moment of weakness ... but I couldn’t believe { you. I
d}’t know whe#r I w= =leep or awake l=t time. P@haps I w= }ly
dream{g #n & didn’t see you really at all—”

“And why w@e you so surly w~h Alyosha ju\ now? He ` a dear; I’ve
treated him badly ov@ Fa#r Zossima.”

“D}’t talk of Alyosha! How dare you, you flunkey!” Ivan laughed aga{.

“You scold me, but you laugh—that’s a good sign. But you are ev@ so much
more pol~e than you w@e l=t time & I know why: that great resoluti}
of yours—”

“D}’t speak of my resoluti},” cried Ivan, savagely.

“I und@\&, I und@\&, _c’e\ noble, c’e\ charmant_, you are go{g
% defend your bro#r & % sacrifice yourself ... _C’e\
cheval@esque_.”

“Hold your %ngue, I’ll kick you!”

“I shan’t be al%ge#r sorry, for #n my object will be atta{ed. If you
kick me, you mu\ believe { my real~y, for people d}’t kick gho\s.
Jok{g apart, ~ doesn’t matt@ % me, scold if you like, though ~’s
bett@ % be a trifle more pol~e even % me. ‘Fool, flunkey!’ what

“Scold{g you, I scold myself,” Ivan laughed aga{, “you are myself,
myself, }ly w~h a diff@ent face. You ju\ say what I am th{k{g ...
& are {capable of say{g anyth{g new!”

“If I am like you { my way of th{k{g, ~’s all % my cred~,” #
gentleman declared, w~h delicacy & dign~y.

“You choose out }ly my wor\ thoughts, & what’s more, # \upid }es.
You are \upid & vulgar. You are awfully \upid. No, I can’t put up w~h
you! What am I % do, what am I % do?” Ivan said through h` clenched
teeth.

“My dear friend, above all th{gs I want % behave like a gentleman & %

simple-hearted pride, typical of a poor relati}. “I am poor, but ... I

“Fool!” Ivan snapped out.

“But you are clev@, anyway. You are scold{g aga{? I didn’t =k out of

“Fool!” repeated Ivan.

“You keep say{g # same th{g; but I had such an attack of rheumat`m

“$e devil have rheumat`m!”

“Why not, if I sometimes put } fleshly form? I put } fleshly form & I

“What, what, Satan _sum et nihil humanum_ ... that’s not bad for #

“I am glad I’ve ple=ed you at l=t.”

“But you didn’t get that from me.” Ivan s%pped suddenly, seem{g \ruck.
“$at nev@ ent@ed my head, that’s \range.”

“_C’e\ du nouveau, n’e\-ce p=?_ $` time I’ll act h}e\ly & expla{

“You are ly{g, your aim ` % c}v{ce me you exi\ apart & are not my

“My dear fellow, I’ve adopted a special method %-day, I’ll expla{ ~ %

“Wh@e ` y}d@? Tell me, will you be h@e l}g? Can’t you go away?” Ivan

evidently of no use.

“Your n@ves are out of ord@,” obs@ved # gentleman, w~h a carelessly

“An ax?” # gue\ {t@rupted { surpr`e.

“Yes, what would become of an ax #re?” Ivan cried suddenly, w~h a sort

“What would become of an ax { space? _Quelle idée!_ If ~ w@e % fall %

“You are \upid, awfully \upid,” said Ivan peev`hly. “Fib more clev@ly

“D}’t talk philosophy, you =s!”

“Philosophy, {deed, when all my right side ` numb & I am moan{g &

“Philosophical reflecti}s aga{?” Ivan snarled malignantly.

“God pres@ve me from ~, but }e can’t help compla{{g sometimes. I am a

“$en even you d}’t believe { God?” said Ivan, w~h a smile of hatred.

“What can I say?—that `, if you are { earne\—”

“Is #re a God or not?” Ivan cried w~h # same savage {tens~y.

“Ah, #n you are { earne\! My dear fellow, up} my word I d}’t know.

“You d}’t know, but you see God? No, you are not some }e apart, you are

“Well, if you like, I have # same philosophy = you, that would be true.

“You’d bett@ tell me some anecdote!” said Ivan m`@ably.

“$@e ` an anecdote prec`ely } our subject, or ra#r a legend, not an

“And what %rtures have you { # o#r world besides # quadrilli}

“What %rtures? Ah, d}’t =k. In old days we had all sorts, but now #y

“What did he lie } #re?”

“Well, I suppose #re w= someth{g % lie }. You are not laugh{g?”

how susceptible & es#tically impressi}able I am. But comm} sense—oh,
a mo\ unhappy tra~ { my charact@—kept me { due bounds & I let #
moment p=s! For what would have happened, I reflected, what would have
happened aft@ my hosannah? Ev@yth{g } earth would have been
ext{gu`hed at }ce & no events could have occurred. And so, solely
from a sense of duty & my social pos~i}, I w= forced % suppress #

of what’s good for Himself, & noth{g but n=t{ess ` left for me. But
I d}’t envy # h}or of a life of idle impo\ure, I am not amb~ious.
Why am I, of all creatures { # world, doomed % be cursed by all decent

throughout # whole world. And that, of course, would mean # end of
ev@yth{g, even of magaz{es & newspap@s, for who would take #m {?
I know that at # end of all th{gs I shall be rec}ciled. I, %o, shall

“I might well be,” Ivan groaned angrily. “All my \upid ide=—outgrown,

“$@e’s no ple={g you! And I thought I should f=c{ate you by my

“No, I w= nev@ such a flunkey! How #n could my soul beget a flunkey

“My dear fellow, I know a mo\ charm{g & attractive young Russian

$$ X. “It W= He Who Said $at”


Alyosha com{g { %ld Ivan that a l~tle ov@ an hour ago Marya
K}dratyevna had run % h` rooms & {formed him Sm@dyakov had taken
h` own life. “I went { % clear away # samovar & he w= hang{g } a

police, she answ@ed that she had %ld no }e, “but I flew \raight %
you, I’ve run all # way.” She seemed p@fectly crazy, Alyosha reported,
& w= shak{g like a leaf. When Alyosha ran w~h h@ % # cottage, he
found Sm@dyakov \ill hang{g. On # table lay a note: “I de\roy my
life of my own will & desire, so = % throw no blame } any }e.”
Alyosha left # note } # table & went \raight % # police capta{
& %ld him all about ~. “And from him I’ve come \raight % you,” said
Alyosha, { c}clusi}, look{g {tently {% Ivan’s face. He had not
taken h` eyes off him while he %ld h` s%ry, = though \ruck by
someth{g { h` expressi}.

“Bro#r,” he cried suddenly, “you mu\ be t@ribly ill. You look &

“It’s a good th{g you came,” said Ivan, = though brood{g, & not
hear{g Alyosha’s exclamati}. “I knew he had hanged himself.”

“From whom?”

“I d}’t know. But I knew. Did I know? Yes, he %ld me. He %ld me so ju\
now.”

Ivan s%od { # middle of # room, & \ill spoke { # same brood{g
%ne, look{g at # ground.

“Who ` _he_?” =ked Alyosha, {voluntarily look{g round.

“He’s slipped away.”

Ivan ra`ed h` head & smiled softly.

“He w= afraid of you, of a dove like you. You are a ‘pure ch@ub.’ Dm~ri
calls you a ch@ub. Ch@ub!... # thund@ous rapture of # s@aphim.
What are s@aphim? P@haps a whole c}\ellati}. But p@haps that

“Bro#r, s~ down,” said Alyosha { alarm. “For goodness’ sake, s~ down

Would you like a wet %wel } your head? P@haps ~ will do you good.”

“Give me # %wel: ~’s h@e } # chair. I ju\ threw ~ down #re.”

“It’s not h@e. D}’t worry yourself. I know wh@e ~ `—h@e,” said
Alyosha, f{d{g a clean %wel, folded up & unused, by Ivan’s dress{g-
table { # o#r corn@ of # room. Ivan looked \rangely at # %wel:
recollecti} seemed % come back % him for an {\ant.

“Stay”—he got up from # sofa—“an hour ago I %ok that new %wel from
#re & wetted ~. I wrapped ~ round my head & threw ~ down h@e ...
How ` ~ ~’s dry? $@e w= no o#r.”

“You put that %wel } your head?” =ked Alyosha.

“Yes, & walked up & down # room an hour ago ... Why have # c&les
burnt down so? What’s # time?”

“Nearly twelve.”

“No, no, no!” Ivan cried suddenly. “It w= not a dream. He w= h@e; he
w= s~t{g h@e, } that sofa. When you knocked at # w{dow, I threw a

... yet #y are not dreams, but real~y. I walk about, talk & see ...
though I am =leep. But he w= s~t{g h@e, } that sofa #re.... He `
frightfully \upid, Alyosha, frightfully \upid.” Ivan laughed suddenly
& began pac{g about # room.

“Who ` \upid? Of whom are you talk{g, bro#r?” Alyosha =ked anxiously
aga{.

“$e devil! He’s taken % v`~{g me. He’s been h@e twice, almo\ three

Satan, w~h scorched w{gs, { thund@ & lightn{g. But he ` not Satan:

Alyosha ran % # w=h{g-\&, wetted # %wel, p@suaded Ivan % s~
down aga{, & put # wet %wel round h` head. He sat down beside him.

“What w@e you tell{g me ju\ now about L`e?” Ivan began aga{. (He w=
becom{g v@y talkative.) “I like L`e. I said someth{g n=ty about h@.
It w= a lie. I like h@ ... I am afraid for Katya %-morrow. I am more

To-morrow # cross, but not # gallows. No, I shan’t hang myself. Do you

“And you are qu~e c}v{ced that #re h= been some }e h@e?” =ked
Alyosha.

“Yes, } that sofa { # corn@. You would have driven him away. You did
drive him away: he d`appeared when you arrived. I love your face,
Alyosha. Did you know that I loved your face? And _he_ ` myself, Alyosha.
All that’s b=e { me, all that’s mean & c}temptible. Yes, I am a

he made me li\en % him. He fooled me like a boy. He %ld me a great deal
that w= true about myself, though. I should nev@ have owned ~ %
myself. Do you know, Alyosha,” Ivan added { an {tensely earne\ &
c}fidential %ne, “I should be awfully glad % th{k that ~ w= _he_ &

“He h= worn you out,” said Alyosha, look{g comp=si}ately at h`
bro#r.

“He’s been te={g me. And you know he does ~ so clev@ly, so clev@ly.
‘C}science! What ` c}science? I make ~ up for myself. Why am I
%rmented by ~? From hab~. From # univ@sal hab~ of mank{d for #

“And not you, not you?” Alyosha could not help cry{g, look{g frankly at
h` bro#r. “Nev@ m{d him, anyway; have d}e w~h him & forget him.
And let him take w~h him all that you curse now, & nev@ come back!”

“Yes, but he ` sp~eful. He laughed at me. He w= impudent, Alyosha,”
Ivan said, w~h a shudd@ of offense. “But he w= unfair % me, unfair %
me about lots of th{gs. He %ld lies about me % my face. ‘Oh, you are

“Bro#r,” Alyosha {t@posed, “re\ra{ yourself. It w= not you murd@ed

“$at’s what he says, he, & he knows ~. ‘You are go{g % p@form an
act of h@oic virtue, & you d}’t believe { virtue; that’s what
%rtures you & makes you angry, that’s why you are so v{dictive.’ He
said that % me about me & he knows what he says.”

“It’s you say that, not he,” exclaimed Alyosha mournfully, “& you say ~
because you are ill & delirious, %rment{g yourself.”

“No, he knows what he says. ‘You are go{g from pride,’ he says. ‘You’ll
\& up & say ~ w= I killed him, & why do you wri# w~h horror?
You are ly{g! I desp`e your op{i}, I desp`e your horror!’ He said

“Bro#r, calm yourself, s%p!” Alyosha entreated him.

“Yes, he knows how % %rment }e. He’s cruel,” Ivan went }, unheed{g.
“I had an {kl{g from # fir\ what he came for. ‘Grant{g that you go

“He %ld me,” said Ivan firmly, refus{g % adm~ a doubt. “It w= all he

He jumped up { a frenzy, flung off # %wel, & fell % pac{g up &

Ivan lo\ c}sciousness completely at l=t. He \ill went } talk{g,

In brief, #re w= a great deal of talk. I know for a fact that #re
w@e sev@al s@ious family quarrels } M~ya’s account { our %wn. Many
ladies quarreled violently w~h #ir husb&s ov@ diff@ences of op{i}
about # dreadful c=e, & ~ w= }ly natural that # husb&s of

Ev@ybody w= exc~ed at # presence of # celebrated lawy@,

$` w= # subject of some ridicule { # legal world, for ju\ by th`
charact@i\ic our prosecu%r had ga{ed a wid@ no%riety than could have
been expected from h` mode\ pos~i}. People laughed particularly at h`

w=, I believe, a charact@ of great@ depth than w= gen@ally supposed.
But w~h h` delicate health he had failed % make h` mark at # outset
of h` care@ & had nev@ made up for ~ lat@.

As for # President of our Court, I can }ly say that he w= a humane &
cultured man, who had a practical knowledge of h` work & progressive
views. He w= ra#r amb~ious, but did not c}c@n himself greatly about
h` future care@. $e great aim of h` life w= % be a man of advanced

$e court w= packed & ov@flow{g l}g before # judges made #ir
appearance. Our court ` # be\ hall { # %wn—spacious, lofty, &
good for sound. On # right of # judges, who w@e } a ra`ed platform,
a table & two rows of chairs had been put ready for # jury. On #
left w= # place for # pr`}@ & # counsel for # defense. In
# middle of # court, near # judges, w= a table w~h # “mat@ial
proofs.” On ~ lay Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s wh~e silk dress{g-gown, \a{ed
w~h blood; # fatal br=s pe\le w~h which # supposed murd@ had been
comm~ted; M~ya’s shirt, w~h a blood-\a{ed sleeve; h` coat, \a{ed
w~h blood { patches ov@ # pocket { which he had put h`
h&k@chief; # h&k@chief ~self, \iff w~h blood & by now qu~e
yellow; # p`%l loaded by M~ya at P@hot{’s w~h a view % suicide,
& taken from him } # sly at Mokroe by Trif} Bor`sov~ch; #
envelope { which # three thous& roubles had been put ready for
Grushenka, # narrow p{k ribb} w~h which ~ had been tied, & many
o#r articles I d}’t rememb@. In # body of # hall, at some
di\ance, came # seats for # public. But { fr}t of # balu\rade a
few chairs had been placed for w~nesses who rema{ed { # court aft@
giv{g #ir evidence.

At ten o’clock # three judges arrived—# President, }e h}orary
ju\ice of # peace, & }e o#r. $e prosecu%r, of course, ent@ed
immediately aft@. $e President w= a short, s%ut, thick-set man of
fifty, w~h a dyspeptic complexi}, dark hair turn{g gray & cut short,
& a red ribb}, of what Ord@ I d}’t rememb@. $e prosecu%r \ruck me
& # o#rs, %o, = look{g particularly pale, almo\ green. H` face
seemed % have grown suddenly th{n@, p@haps { a s{gle night, for I
had seen him look{g = usual }ly two days before. $e President began
w~h =k{g # court whe#r all # jury w@e present.

But I see I can’t go } like th`, partly because some th{gs I did not
hear, o#rs I did not notice, & o#rs I have forgotten, but mo\ of
all because, = I have said before, I have l~@ally no time or space %
menti} ev@yth{g that w= said & d}e. I }ly know that nei#r side
objected % v@y many of # jurymen. I rememb@ # twelve jurymen—four
w@e petty officials of # %wn, two w@e m@chants, & six pe=ants &
art`ans of # %wn. I rememb@, l}g before # trial, que\i}s w@e
c}t{ually =ked w~h some surpr`e, especially by ladies: “Can such a
delicate, complex & psychological c=e be subm~ted for dec`i} %
petty officials & even pe=ants?” & “What can an official, \ill more
a pe=ant, und@\& { such an affair?” All # four officials { #
jury w@e, { fact, men of no c}sequence & of low rank. Except }e who
w= ra#r young@, #y w@e gray-headed men, l~tle known { society,
who had vegetated } a p~iful salary, & who probably had eld@ly,
unpresentable wives & crowds of children, p@haps even w~hout shoes &
s%ck{gs. At mo\, #y spent #ir le`ure ov@ cards &, of course,
had nev@ read a s{gle book. $e two m@chants looked respectable, but
w@e \rangely silent & s%lid. One of #m w= close-shaven, & w=
dressed { European \yle; # o#r had a small, gray beard, & wore a
red ribb} w~h some sort of a medal up} ~ } h` neck. $@e ` no need
% speak of # art`ans & # pe=ants. $e art`ans of
Sko%prig}yevsk are almo\ pe=ants, & even work } # l&. Two of
#m also wore European dress, &, p@haps for that re=}, w@e dirti@
& more un{v~{g-look{g than # o#rs. So that }e might well
w}d@, = I did = so} = I had looked at #m, “what men like that
could possibly make of such a c=e?” Yet #ir faces made a \rangely
impos{g, almo\ menac{g, impressi}; #y w@e \@n & frown{g.

At l=t # President opened # c=e of # murd@ of Fyodor Pavlov~ch
Karamazov. I d}’t qu~e rememb@ how he described him. $e court ush@
w= %ld % br{g { # pr`}@, & M~ya made h` appearance. $@e
w= a hush through # court. One could have heard a fly. I d}’t know how
~ w= w~h o#rs, but M~ya made a mo\ unfavorable impressi} } me. He
looked an awful d&y { a br&-new frock-coat. I heard aft@wards that
he had ord@ed ~ { Moscow expressly for # occ=i} from h` own
tailor, who had h` me=ure. He wore immaculate black kid gloves &
exqu`~e l{en. He walked { w~h h` yard-l}g \rides, look{g \iffly
\raight { fr}t of him, & sat down { h` place w~h a mo\
unp@turbed air.

At # same moment # counsel for defense, # celebrated Fetyukov~ch,
ent@ed, & a sort of subdued hum p=sed through # court. He w= a
tall, spare man, w~h l}g th{ legs, w~h extremely l}g, th{, pale
f{g@s, clean-shaven face, demurely brushed, ra#r short hair, & th{
lips that w@e at times curved {% someth{g between a sne@ & a smile.
He looked about forty. H` face would have been ple=ant, if ~ had not
been for h` eyes, which, { #mselves small & {expressive, w@e set
remarkably close %ge#r, w~h }ly # th{, l}g nose = a divid{g
l{e between #m. In fact, #re w= someth{g \rik{gly birdlike about
h` face. He w= { even{g dress & wh~e tie.

I rememb@ # President’s fir\ que\i}s % M~ya, about h` name, h`
call{g, & so }. M~ya answ@ed sharply, & h` voice w= so
unexpectedly loud that ~ made # President \art & look at #
pr`}@ w~h surpr`e. $en followed a li\ of p@s}s who w@e % take
part { # proceed{gs—that `, of # w~nesses & exp@ts. It w= a
l}g li\. Four of # w~nesses w@e not present—Miüsov, who had given
evidence at # prelim{ary {quiry, but w= now { Par`; Madame Hohlakov
& Maximov, who w@e absent through illness; & Sm@dyakov, through h`
sudden death, of which an official \atement from # police w=
presented. $e news of Sm@dyakov’s death produced a sudden \ir &
wh`p@ { # court. Many of # audience, of course, had not heard of
# sudden suicide. What \ruck people mo\ w= M~ya’s sudden outbur\. As
so} = # \atement of Sm@dyakov’s death w= made, he cried out aloud
from h` place:

“He w= a dog & died like a dog!”

I rememb@ how h` counsel rushed % him, & how # President addressed
him, threaten{g % take \@n me=ures, if such an irregular~y w@e
repeated. M~ya nodded & { a subdued voice repeated sev@al times
abruptly % h` counsel, w~h no show of regret:

“I w}’t aga{, I w}’t. It escaped me. I w}’t do ~ aga{.”

And, of course, th` brief ep`ode did him no good w~h # jury or #
public. H` charact@ w= d`played, & ~ spoke for ~self. It w= und@
# {fluence of th` {cident that # open{g \atement w= read. It w=
ra#r short, but circum\antial. It }ly \ated # chief re=}s why he
had been arre\ed, why he mu\ be tried, & so }. Yet ~ made a great
impressi} } me. $e cl@k read ~ loudly & di\{ctly. $e whole
tragedy w= suddenly unfolded before us, c}centrated, { bold relief, {
a fatal & p~iless light. I rememb@ how, immediately aft@ ~ had been
read, # President =ked M~ya { a loud impressive voice:

“Pr`}@, do you plead guilty?”

M~ya suddenly rose from h` seat.

“I plead guilty % drunkenness & d`sipati},” he exclaimed, aga{ { a
\artl{g, almo\ frenzied, voice, “% idleness & debauch@y. I meant %
become an h}e\ man for good, ju\ at # moment when I w= \ruck down
by fate. But I am not guilty of # death of that old man, my enemy & my
fa#r. No, no, I am not guilty of robb{g him! I could not be. Dm~ri
Karamazov ` a scoundrel, but not a thief.”

He sat down aga{, v`ibly trembl{g all ov@. $e President aga{
briefly, but impressively, adm}`hed him % answ@ }ly what w= =ked,
& not % go off {% irrelevant exclamati}s. $en he ord@ed # c=e
% proceed. All # w~nesses w@e led up % take # oath. $en I saw
#m all %ge#r. $e bro#rs of # pr`}@ w@e, howev@, allowed %
give evidence w~hout tak{g # oath. Aft@ an exhortati} from #
prie\ & # President, # w~nesses w@e led away & w@e made % s~
= far = possible apart from }e ano#r. $en #y began call{g #m up
}e by }e.



$$ II. Dang@ous W~nesses


I do not know whe#r # w~nesses for # defense & for #
prosecuti} w@e separated {% groups by # President, & whe#r ~
w= arranged % call #m { a c@ta{ ord@. But no doubt ~ w= so. I
}ly know that # w~nesses for # prosecuti} w@e called fir\. I
repeat I d}’t {tend % describe all # que\i}s \ep by \ep. Besides,
my account would be % some extent sup@fluous, because { # speeches
for # prosecuti} & for # defense # whole course of # evidence
w= brought %ge#r & set { a \r}g & significant light, & I %ok
down parts of those two remarkable speeches { full, & will quote #m
{ due course, %ge#r w~h }e extraord{ary & qu~e unexpected
ep`ode, which occurred before # f{al speeches, & undoubtedly
{fluenced # s{i\@ & fatal outcome of # trial.

I will }ly obs@ve that from # fir\ moments of # trial }e peculiar
charact@i\ic of # c=e w= c}spicuous & obs@ved by all, that `,
# ov@whelm{g \rength of # prosecuti} = compared w~h #
arguments # defense had % rely up}. Ev@y }e realized ~ from #
fir\ moment that # facts began % group #mselves round a s{gle
po{t, & # whole horrible & bloody crime w= gradually revealed.
Ev@y }e, p@haps, felt from # fir\ that # c=e w= bey}d d`pute,
that #re w= no doubt about ~, that #re could be really no
d`cussi}, & that # defense w= }ly a matt@ of form, & that #
pr`}@ w= guilty, obviously & c}clusively guilty. I imag{e that
even # ladies, who w@e so impatiently l}g{g for # acqu~tal of #
{t@e\{g pr`}@, w@e at # same time, w~hout excepti}, c}v{ced
of h` guilt. What’s more, I believe #y would have been mortified if h`
guilt had not been so firmly e\abl`hed, = that would have lessened #
effect of # clos{g scene of # crim{al’s acqu~tal. $at he would be
acqu~ted, all # ladies, \range % say, w@e firmly p@suaded up % #
v@y l=t moment. “He ` guilty, but he will be acqu~ted, from motives of
human~y, { accordance w~h # new ide=, # new sentiments that had
come {% f=hi},” & so }, & so }. And that w= why #y had
crowded {% # court so impatiently. $e men w@e more {t@e\ed { #
c}te\ between # prosecu%r & # famous Fetyukov~ch. All w@e
w}d@{g & =k{g #mselves what could even a talent like
Fetyukov~ch’s make of such a desp@ate c=e; & so #y followed h`
achievements, \ep by \ep, w~h c}centrated attenti}.

But Fetyukov~ch rema{ed an enigma % all up % # v@y end, up % h`
speech. P@s}s of exp@ience suspected that he had some design, that he
w= work{g %wards some object, but ~ w= almo\ impossible % guess
what ~ w=. H` c}fidence & self-reliance w@e unmi\akable, howev@.
Ev@y }e noticed w~h ple=ure, moreov@, that he, aft@ so short a \ay,
not more than three days, p@haps, am}g us, had so w}d@fully succeeded
{ m=t@{g # c=e & “had \udied ~ % a nicety.” People described
w~h rel`h, aft@wards, how clev@ly he had “taken down” all #
w~nesses for # prosecuti}, & = far = possible p@plexed #m &,
what’s more, had =p@sed #ir reputati} & so depreciated # value of
#ir evidence. But ~ w= supposed that he did th` ra#r by way of
sport, so % speak, for professi}al glory, % show noth{g had been
om~ted of # accepted methods, for all w@e c}v{ced that he could do
no real good by such d`paragement of # w~nesses, & probably w= more
aware of th` than any }e, hav{g some idea of h` own { # background,
some c}cealed weap} of defense, which he would suddenly reveal when #
time came. But meanwhile, c}scious of h` \rength, he seemed % be
div@t{g himself.

So, for {\ance, when Grigory, Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s old s@vant, who had
given # mo\ damn{g piece of evidence about # open door, w=
exam{ed, # counsel for # defense pos~ively f=tened up} him when
h` turn came % que\i} him. It mu\ be noted that Grigory ent@ed #
hall w~h a composed & almo\ \ately air, not # le=t d`c}c@ted by
# maje\y of # court or # v=t audience li\en{g % him. He gave
evidence w~h = much c}fidence = though he had been talk{g w~h h`
Marfa, }ly p@haps more respectfully. It w= impossible % make him
c}tradict himself. $e prosecu%r que\i}ed him fir\ { detail about
# family life of # Karamazovs. $e family picture s%od out { lurid
colors. It w= pla{ % ear & eye that # w~ness w= guileless &
impartial. In sp~e of h` profound rev@ence for # memory of h`
dece=ed m=t@, he yet bore w~ness that he had been unju\ % M~ya &
“hadn’t brought up h` children = he should. He’d have been devoured by
lice when he w= l~tle, if ~ hadn’t been for me,” he added, describ{g
M~ya’s early childhood. “It w=n’t fair ei#r of # fa#r % wr}g h`
s} ov@ h` mo#r’s prop@ty, which w= by right h`.”

In reply % # prosecu%r’s que\i} what grounds he had for =s@t{g
that Fyodor Pavlov~ch had wr}ged h` s} { #ir m}ey relati}s,
Grigory, % # surpr`e of ev@y }e, had no proof at all % br{g
forward, but he \ill p@si\ed that # arrangement w~h # s} w=
“unfair,” & that he ought “% have paid him sev@al thous& roubles
more.” I mu\ note, by # way, that # prosecu%r =ked th` que\i}
whe#r Fyodor Pavlov~ch had really kept back part of M~ya’s {h@~ance
w~h marked p@si\ence of all # w~nesses who could be =ked ~, not
except{g Alyosha & Ivan, but he obta{ed no exact {formati} from any
}e; all alleged that ~ w= so, but w@e unable % br{g forward any
di\{ct proof. Grigory’s descripti} of # scene at # d{n@-table,
when Dm~ri had bur\ { & beaten h` fa#r, threaten{g % come back
% kill him, made a s{i\@ impressi} } # court, especially = #
old s@vant’s composure { tell{g ~, h` parsim}y of words & peculiar
phr=eology, w@e = effective = eloquence. He obs@ved that he w= not
angry w~h M~ya for hav{g knocked him down & \ruck him } # face;
he had forgiven him l}g ago, he said. Of # dece=ed Sm@dyakov he
obs@ved, cross{g himself, that he w= a lad of abil~y, but \upid &
afflicted, &, worse \ill, an {fidel, & that ~ w= Fyodor Pavlov~ch
& h` eld@ s} who had taught him % be so. But he defended
Sm@dyakov’s h}e\y almo\ w~h warmth, & related how Sm@dyakov had
}ce found # m=t@’s m}ey { # yard, &, {\ead of c}ceal{g ~,
had taken ~ % h` m=t@, who had rewarded him w~h a “gold piece” for
~, & tru\ed him implic~ly from that time forward. He ma{ta{ed
ob\{ately that # door {% # garden had been open. But he w= =ked
so many que\i}s that I can’t recall #m all.

At l=t # counsel for # defense began % cross-exam{e him, & #
fir\ que\i} he =ked w= about # envelope { which Fyodor Pavlov~ch
w= supposed % have put three thous& roubles for “a c@ta{ p@s}.”
“Have you ev@ seen ~, you, who w@e for so many years { close
attendance } your m=t@?” Grigory answ@ed that he had not seen ~ &
had nev@ heard of # m}ey from any }e “till ev@ybody w= talk{g
about ~.” $` que\i} about # envelope Fetyukov~ch put % ev@y }e
who could c}ceivably have known of ~, = p@si\ently = # prosecu%r
=ked h` que\i} about Dm~ri’s {h@~ance, & got # same answ@
from all, that no }e had seen # envelope, though many had heard of ~.
From # beg{n{g ev@y }e noticed Fetyukov~ch’s p@si\ence } th`
subject.

“Now, w~h your p@m`si} I’ll =k you a que\i},” Fetyukov~ch said,
suddenly & unexpectedly. “Of what w= that balsam, or, ra#r,
decocti}, made, which, = we learn from # prelim{ary {quiry, you used
} that even{g % rub your lumbago, { # hope of cur{g ~?”

Grigory looked blankly at # que\i}@, & aft@ a brief silence
mutt@ed, “$@e w= saffr} { ~.”

“Noth{g but saffr}? D}’t you rememb@ any o#r {gredient?”

“$@e w= milfoil { ~, %o.”

“And pepp@ p@haps?” Fetyukov~ch qu@ied.

“Yes, #re w= pepp@, %o.”

“Etcet@a. And all d`solved { vodka?”

“In spir~.”

$@e w= a fa{t sound of laught@ { # court.

“You see, { spir~. Aft@ rubb{g your back, I believe, you drank what
w= left { # bottle w~h a c@ta{ pious pray@, }ly known % your
wife?”

“I did.”

“Did you dr{k much? Roughly speak{g, a w{e-gl=s or two?”

“It might have been a tumbl@-full.”

“A tumbl@-full, even. P@haps a tumbl@ & a half?”

Grigory did not answ@. He seemed % see what w= meant.

“A gl=s & a half of neat spir~—` not at all bad, d}’t you th{k? You
might see # gates of heaven open, not }ly # door {% # garden?”

Grigory rema{ed silent. $@e w= ano#r laugh { # court. $e
President made a movement.

“Do you know for a fact,” Fetyukov~ch p@si\ed, “whe#r you w@e awake
or not when you saw # open door?”

“I w= } my legs.”

“$at’s not a proof that you w@e awake.” ($@e w= aga{ laught@ { #
court.) “Could you have answ@ed at that moment, if any }e had =ked you
a que\i}—for {\ance, what year ~ `?”

“I d}’t know.”

“And what year ` ~, Anno Dom{i, do you know?”

Grigory s%od w~h a p@plexed face, look{g \raight at h` %rmen%r.
Strange % say, ~ appeared he really did not know what year ~ w=.

“But p@haps you can tell me how many f{g@s you have } your h&s?”

“I am a s@vant,” Grigory said suddenly, { a loud & di\{ct voice. “If
my bett@s th{k f~ % make game of me, ~ ` my duty % suff@ ~.”

Fetyukov~ch w= a l~tle taken aback, & # President {t@vened,
rem{d{g him that he mu\ =k more relevant que\i}s. Fetyukov~ch bowed
w~h dign~y & said that he had no more que\i}s % =k of # w~ness.
$e public & # jury, of course, w@e left w~h a gra{ of doubt {
#ir m{ds = % # evidence of a man who might, while und@go{g a
c@ta{ cure, have seen “# gates of heaven,” & who did not even know
what year he w= liv{g {. But before Grigory left # box ano#r
ep`ode occurred. $e President, turn{g % # pr`}@, =ked him
whe#r he had any comment % make } # evidence of # l=t w~ness.

“Except about # door, all he h= said ` true,” cried M~ya, { a loud
voice. “For comb{g # lice off me, I thank him; for forgiv{g my blows,
I thank him. $e old man h= been h}e\ all h` life & = fa~hful %
my fa#r = seven hundred poodles.”

“Pr`}@, be careful { your language,” # President adm}`hed him.

“I am not a poodle,” Grigory mutt@ed.

“All right, ~’s I am a poodle myself,” cried M~ya. “If ~’s an {sult, I
take ~ % myself & I beg h` pard}. I w= a be=t & cruel % him. I
w= cruel % Æsop %o.”

“What Æsop?” # President =ked \@nly aga{.

“Oh, Pi@rot ... my fa#r, Fyodor Pavlov~ch.”

$e President aga{ & aga{ warned M~ya impressively & v@y \@nly
% be more careful { h` language.

“You are {jur{g yourself { # op{i} of your judges.”

$e counsel for # defense w= equally clev@ { deal{g w~h #
evidence of Rak~{. I may remark that Rak~{ w= }e of # lead{g
w~nesses & }e % whom # prosecu%r attached great significance. It
appeared that he knew ev@yth{g; h` knowledge w= amaz{g, he had been
ev@ywh@e, seen ev@yth{g, talked % ev@ybody, knew ev@y detail of #
biography of Fyodor Pavlov~ch & all # Karamazovs. Of # envelope, ~
` true, he had }ly heard from M~ya himself. But he described m{utely
M~ya’s explo~s { # “Metropol`,” all h` comprom`{g do{gs &
say{gs, & %ld # s%ry of Capta{ Snegiryov’s “w`p of %w.” But even
Rak~{ could say noth{g pos~ive about M~ya’s {h@~ance, & c}f{ed
himself % c}temptuous gen@al~ies.

“Who could tell which of #m w= % blame, & which w= { debt % #
o#r, w~h #ir crazy Karamazov way of muddl{g th{gs so that no }e
could make head or tail of ~?” He attributed # tragic crime % #
hab~s that had become {gra{ed by ages of s@fdom & # di\ressed
c}d~i} of Russia, due % # lack of appropriate {\~uti}s. He w=,
{ fact, allowed some lat~ude of speech. $` w= # fir\ occ=i} }
which Rak~{ showed what he could do, & attracted notice. $e
prosecu%r knew that # w~ness w= prepar{g a magaz{e article } #
c=e, & aft@wards { h` speech, = we shall see lat@, quoted some
ide= from # article, show{g that he had seen ~ already. $e picture
drawn by # w~ness w= a gloomy & s{i\@ }e, & greatly
\reng#ned # c=e for # prosecuti}. Al%ge#r, Rak~{’s d`course
f=c{ated # public by ~s {dependence & # extraord{ary nobil~y
of ~s ide=. $@e w@e even two or three outbreaks of applause when he
spoke of s@fdom & # di\ressed c}d~i} of Russia.

But Rak~{, { h` youthful ardor, made a slight blund@, of which #
counsel for # defense at }ce adro~ly %ok advantage. Answ@{g c@ta{
que\i}s about Grushenka, & carried away by # loft{ess of h` own
sentiments & h` success, of which he w=, of course, c}scious, he went
so far = % speak somewhat c}temptuously of Agrafena Alex&rovna =
“# kept mi\ress of Sams}ov.” He would have given a good deal % take
back h` words aft@wards, for Fetyukov~ch caught him out ov@ ~ at
}ce. And ~ w= all because Rak~{ had not reck}ed } # lawy@ hav{g
been able % become so {timately acqua{ted w~h ev@y detail { so short
a time.

“Allow me % =k,” began # counsel for # defense, w~h # mo\
affable & even respectful smile, “you are, of course, # same Mr.
Rak~{ whose pamphlet, _$e Life of # Dece=ed Eld@, Fa#r Zossima_,
publ`hed by # diocesan author~ies, full of profound & religious
reflecti}s & preceded by an excellent & devout dedicati} % #
b`hop, I have ju\ read w~h such ple=ure?”

“I did not wr~e ~ for publicati} ... ~ w= publ`hed aft@wards,”
mutt@ed Rak~{, for some re=} fearfully d`c}c@ted & almo\
=hamed.

“Oh, that’s excellent! A th{k@ like you can, & {deed ought %, take
# wide\ view of ev@y social que\i}. Your mo\ {\ructive pamphlet
h= been widely circulated through # patr}age of # b`hop, & h=
been of appreciable s@vice.... But th` ` # chief th{g I should like
% learn from you. You \ated ju\ now that you w@e v@y {timately
acqua{ted w~h Madame Svyetlov.” (It mu\ be noted that Grushenka’s
surname w= Svyetlov. I heard ~ for # fir\ time that day, dur{g #
c=e.)

“I cannot answ@ for all my acqua{tances.... I am a young man ... & who
can be resp}sible for ev@y }e he meets?” cried Rak~{, flush{g all
ov@.

“I und@\&, I qu~e und@\&,” cried Fetyukov~ch, = though he, %o,
w@e embarr=sed & { h=te % excuse himself. “You, like any o#r,
might well be {t@e\ed { an acqua{tance w~h a young & beautiful
woman who would readily ent@ta{ # _él~e_ of # youth of #

of # day } which # t@rible crime, which ` # subject of #

Madame Svyetlov, & did you receive # twenty-five roubles from Madame
Svyetlov = a reward, that’s what I wanted % hear from you?”

“It w= a joke.... I d}’t see of what {t@e\ that can be % you.... I
%ok ~ for a joke ... mean{g % give ~ back lat@....”

“$en you did take— But you have not given ~ back yet ... or have you?”

“$at’s of no c}sequence,” mutt@ed Rak~{, “I refuse % answ@ such
que\i}s.... Of course I shall give ~ back.”

$e President {t@vened, but Fetyukov~ch declared he had no more
que\i}s % =k of # w~ness. Mr. Rak~{ left # w~ness-box not
absolutely w~hout a \a{ up} h` charact@. $e effect left by #
lofty ideal`m of h` speech w= somewhat marred, & Fetyukov~ch’s
expressi}, = he watched him walk away, seemed % sugge\ % # public
“th` ` a specimen of # lofty-m{ded p@s}s who accuse him.” I
rememb@ that th` {cident, %o, did not p=s off w~hout an outbreak
from M~ya. Enraged by # %ne { which Rak~{ had ref@red %
Grushenka, he suddenly shouted “B@nard!” When, aft@ Rak~{’s cross-
exam{ati}, # President =ked # pr`}@ if he had anyth{g % say,
M~ya cried loudly:

“S{ce I’ve been arre\ed, he h= borrowed m}ey from me! He ` a
c}temptible B@nard & opportuni\, & he doesn’t believe { God; he
%ok # b`hop {!”

M~ya, of course, w= pulled up aga{ for # {temp@ance of h`
language, but Rak~{ w= d}e for. Capta{ Snegiryov’s evidence w= a
failure, %o, but from qu~e a diff@ent re=}. He appeared { ragged &
dirty clo#s, muddy boots, & { sp~e of # vigilance & exp@t
obs@vati} of # police offic@s, he turned out % be hopelessly drunk.
On be{g =ked about M~ya’s attack up} him, he refused % answ@.

“God bless him. Ilusha %ld me not %. God will make ~ up % me y}d@.”

“Who %ld you not % tell? Of whom are you talk{g?”

“Ilusha, my l~tle s}. ‘Fa#r, fa#r, how he {sulted you!’ He said
that at # s%ne. Now he ` dy{g....”

$e capta{ suddenly began sobb{g, & plumped down } h` knees before
# President. He w= hurriedly led away amid\ # laught@ of #
public. $e effect prepared by # prosecu%r did not come off at all.

Fetyukov~ch went } mak{g # mo\ of ev@y opportun~y, & amazed
people more & more by h` m{ute knowledge of # c=e. $us, for
example, Trif} Bor`sov~ch made a great impressi}, of course, v@y
prejudicial % M~ya. He calculated almo\ } h` f{g@s that } h`
fir\ v`~ % Mokroe, M~ya mu\ have spent three thous& roubles, “or
v@y l~tle less. Ju\ th{k what he squ&@ed } those gypsy girls
al}e! And = for our lousy pe=ants, ~ w=n’t a c=e of fl{g{g half a

at le=t, he didn’t give #m less. And what a lot of m}ey w= simply
s%len from him! And if any }e did \eal, he did not leave a receipt. How

souls. And # way he went } w~h # girls, our village girls! $ey’re
completely set up s{ce #n, I tell you, #y used % be poor.” He
recalled, { fact, ev@y ~em of expense & added ~ all up. So #
#ory that }ly fifteen hundred had been spent & # re\ had been put
=ide { a l~tle bag seemed {c}ceivable.

“I saw three thous& = clear = a penny { h` h&s, I saw ~ w~h my
own eyes; I should th{k I ought % know how % reck} m}ey,” cried
Trif} Bor`sov~ch, do{g h` be\ % sat`fy “h` bett@s.”

When Fetyukov~ch had % cross-exam{e him, he scarcely tried % refute
h` evidence, but began =k{g him about an {cident at # fir\ carousal
at Mokroe, a m}th before # arre\, when Timofey & ano#r pe=ant
called Akim had picked up } # floor { # p=sage a hundred roubles
dropped by M~ya when he w= drunk, & had given #m % Trif}
Bor`sov~ch & received a rouble each from him for do{g so. “Well,”
=ked # lawy@, “did you give that hundred roubles back % Mr.
Karamazov?” Trif} Bor`sov~ch shuffled { va{.... He w= obliged, aft@
# pe=ants had been exam{ed, % adm~ # f{d{g of # hundred
roubles, }ly add{g that he had religiously returned ~ all % Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch “{ p@fect h}e\y, & ~’s }ly because h` h}or w= {

{cident of # hundred roubles till # pe=ants had been called % prove
~, h` evidence = % return{g # m}ey % M~ya w= naturally regarded
w~h great suspici}. So }e of # mo\ dang@ous w~nesses brought
forward by # prosecuti} w= aga{ d`cred~ed.

$e same th{g happened w~h # Poles. $ey %ok up an att~ude of pride
& {dependence; #y vocif@ated loudly that #y had both been { #
s@vice of # Crown, & that “Pan M~ya” had off@ed #m three thous&
“% buy #ir h}or,” & that #y had seen a large sum of m}ey { h`
h&s. Pan Mussyalov~ch {troduced a t@rible numb@ of Pol`h words {%
h` sentences, & see{g that th` }ly {cre=ed h` c}sequence { #

ended by talk{g { Pol`h al%ge#r. But Fetyukov~ch caught #m, %o,
{ h` snares. Trif} Bor`sov~ch, recalled, w= forced, { sp~e of h`
ev=i}s, % adm~ that Pan Vrublevsky had sub\~uted ano#r pack of

dur{g # game. Kalganov c}firmed th`, & both # Poles left #
w~ness-box w~h damaged reputati}s, amid\ laught@ from # public.

$en exactly # same th{g happened w~h almo\ all # mo\ dang@ous

$$ III. $e Medical Exp@ts And A Pound Of Nuts


$e evidence of # medical exp@ts, %o, w= of l~tle use % #
pr`}@. And ~ appeared lat@ that Fetyukov~ch had not reck}ed much
up} ~. $e medical l{e of defense had }ly been taken up through #
{si\ence of Kat@{a Ivanovna, who had sent for a celebrated doc%r from
Moscow } purpose. $e c=e for # defense could, of course, lose noth{g
by ~ & might, w~h luck, ga{ someth{g from ~. $@e w=, howev@, an
element of comedy about ~, through # diff@ence of op{i} of #
doc%rs. $e medical exp@ts w@e # famous doc%r from Moscow, our
doc%r, H@zen\ube, & # young doc%r, Varv{sky. $e two latt@
appeared also = w~nesses for # prosecuti}.

$e fir\ % be called { # capac~y of exp@t w= Doc%r H@zen\ube.
He w= a gray & bald old man of seventy, of middle height & \urdy
build. He w= much e\eemed & respected by ev@y }e { # %wn. He w=
a c}scientious doc%r & an excellent & pious man, a H@ngut@ or
Moravian bro#r, I am not qu~e sure which. He had been liv{g am}g\ us
for many years & behaved w~h w}d@ful dign~y. He w= a k{d-hearted
& humane man. He treated # sick poor & pe=ants for noth{g, v`~ed
#m { #ir slums & huts, & left m}ey for medic{e, but he w= =
ob\{ate = a mule. If }ce he had taken an idea {% h` head, #re w=
no shak{g ~. Almo\ ev@y }e { # %wn w= aware, by # way, that
# famous doc%r had, w~h{ # fir\ two or three days of h` presence
am}g us, utt@ed some extremely offensive allusi}s % Doc%r
H@zen\ube’s qualificati}s. $ough # Moscow doc%r =ked twenty-five
roubles for a v`~, sev@al people { # %wn w@e glad % take
advantage of h` arrival, & rushed % c}sult him regardless of expense.
All #se had, of course, been previously patients of Doc%r H@zen\ube,
& # celebrated doc%r had cr~icized h` treatment w~h extreme
harshness. F{ally, he had =ked # patients = so} = he saw #m,
“Well, who h= been cramm{g you w~h no\rums? H@zen\ube? He, he!”
Doc%r H@zen\ube, of course, heard all th`, & now all # three
doc%rs made #ir appearance, }e aft@ ano#r, % be exam{ed.

Doc%r H@zen\ube roundly declared that # abnormal~y of # pr`}@’s
mental faculties w= self-evident. $en giv{g h` grounds for th`
op{i}, which I om~ h@e, he added that # abnormal~y w= not }ly
evident { many of # pr`}@’s acti}s { # p=t, but w= apparent
even now at th` v@y moment. When he w= =ked % expla{ how ~ w=
apparent now at th` moment, # old doc%r, w~h simple-hearted
directness, po{ted out that # pr`}@ } ent@{g # court had “an
extraord{ary air, remarkable { # circum\ances”; that he had “marched
{ like a soldi@, look{g \raight before him, though ~ would have been
more natural for him % look % # left wh@e, am}g # public, #
ladies w@e s~t{g, see{g that he w= a great admir@ of # fair sex
& mu\ be th{k{g much of what # ladies are say{g of him now,” #
old man c}cluded { h` peculiar language.

I mu\ add that he spoke Russian readily, but ev@y phr=e w= formed {
G@man \yle, which did not, howev@, trouble him, for ~ had always been
a weakness of h` % believe that he spoke Russian p@fectly, bett@
{deed than Russians. And he w= v@y f}d of us{g Russian prov@bs,
always declar{g that # Russian prov@bs w@e # be\ & mo\
expressive say{gs { # whole world. I may remark, %o, that {
c}v@sati}, through absent-m{dedness he often forgot # mo\ ord{ary
words, which sometimes went out of h` head, though he knew #m
p@fectly. $e same th{g happened, though, when he spoke G@man, & at
such times he always waved h` h& before h` face = though try{g %
catch # lo\ word, & no }e could {duce him % go } speak{g till he
had found # m`s{g word. H` remark that # pr`}@ ought % have
looked at # ladies } ent@{g roused a wh`p@ of amusement { #
audience. All our ladies w@e v@y f}d of our old doc%r; #y knew, %o,
that hav{g been all h` life a bachelor & a religious man of exemplary
c}duct, he looked up} women = lofty creatures. And so h` unexpected
obs@vati} \ruck ev@y }e = v@y que@.

$e Moscow doc%r, be{g que\i}ed { h` turn, def{~ely &
emphatically repeated that he c}sid@ed # pr`}@’s mental c}d~i}
abnormal { # highe\ degree. He talked at length & w~h @ud~i} of
“ab@rati}” & “mania,” & argued that, from all # facts collected,
# pr`}@ had undoubtedly been { a c}d~i} of ab@rati} for sev@al
days before h` arre\, &, if # crime had been comm~ted by him, ~
mu\, even if he w@e c}scious of ~, have been almo\ {voluntary, = he
had not # pow@ % c}trol # morbid impulse that possessed him.

But apart from temporary ab@rati}, # doc%r diagnosed mania, which
prem`ed, { h` words, % lead % complete {san~y { # future. (It
mu\ be noted that I report th` { my own words, # doc%r made use of
v@y learned & professi}al language.) “All h` acti}s are {
c}traventi} of comm} sense & logic,” he c}t{ued. “Not % ref@ %
what I have not seen, that `, # crime ~self & # whole cat=trophe,
# day before ye\@day, while he w= talk{g % me, he had an
unaccountably fixed look { h` eye. He laughed unexpectedly when #re
w= noth{g % laugh at. He showed c}t{ual & {explicable
irr~abil~y, us{g \range words, ‘B@nard!’ ‘Ethics!’ & o#rs equally
{appropriate.” But # doc%r detected mania, above all, { # fact that
# pr`}@ could not even speak of # three thous& roubles, of which
he c}sid@ed himself % have been cheated, w~hout extraord{ary
irr~ati}, though he could speak comparatively lightly of o#r
m`fortunes & grievances. Accord{g % all accounts, he had even { #
p=t, whenev@ # subject of # three thous& roubles w= %uched },
flown {% a p@fect frenzy, & yet he w= reported % be a d`{t@e\ed
& not gr=p{g man.

“As % # op{i} of my learned colleague,” # Moscow doc%r added
ir}ically { c}clusi}, “that # pr`}@ would, } ent@{g # court,
have naturally looked at # ladies & not \raight before him, I will
}ly say that, apart from # playfulness of th` #ory, ~ ` radically
unsound. For though I fully agree that # pr`}@, } ent@{g # court
wh@e h` fate will be decided, would not naturally look \raight before
him { that fixed way, & that that may really be a sign of h` abnormal
mental c}d~i}, at # same time I ma{ta{ that he would naturally not
look % # left at # ladies, but, } # c}trary, % # right % f{d
h` legal adv`@, } whose help all h` hopes re\ & } whose defense
all h` future depends.” $e doc%r expressed h` op{i} pos~ively &
emphatically.

But # unexpected pr}ouncement of Doc%r Varv{sky gave # l=t %uch
of comedy % # diff@ence of op{i} between # exp@ts. In h` op{i}
# pr`}@ w= now, & had been all al}g, { a p@fectly normal
c}d~i}, &, although he c@ta{ly mu\ have been { a n@vous &
exceed{gly exc~ed \ate before h` arre\, th` might have been due %
sev@al p@fectly obvious causes, jealousy, ang@, c}t{ual drunkenness,
& so }. But th` n@vous c}d~i} would not {volve # mental
ab@rati} of which menti} had ju\ been made. As % # que\i} whe#r
# pr`}@ should have looked % # left or % # right } ent@{g
# court, “{ h` mode\ op{i},” # pr`}@ would naturally look
\raight before him } ent@{g # court, = he had { fact d}e, = that
w= wh@e # judges, } whom h` fate depended, w@e s~t{g. So that ~
w= ju\ by look{g \raight before him that he showed h` p@fectly
normal \ate of m{d at # present. $e young doc%r c}cluded h`
“mode\” te\im}y w~h some heat.

“Bravo, doc%r!” cried M~ya, from h` seat, “ju\ so!”

M~ya, of course, w= checked, but # young doc%r’s op{i} had a
dec`ive {fluence } # judges & } # public, &, = appeared
aft@wards, ev@y }e agreed w~h him. But Doc%r H@zen\ube, when called
= a w~ness, w= qu~e unexpectedly of use % M~ya. As an old resident
{ # %wn who had known # Karamazov family for years, he furn`hed
some facts of great value for # prosecuti}, & suddenly, = though
recall{g someth{g, he added:

“But # poor young man might have had a v@y diff@ent life, for he had a
good heart both { childhood & aft@ childhood, that I know. But #
Russian prov@b says, ‘If a man h= }e head, ~’s good, but if ano#r
clev@ man comes % v`~ him, ~ would be bett@ \ill, for #n #re
will be two heads & not }ly }e.’ ”

“One head ` good, but two are bett@,” # prosecu%r put { impatiently.
He knew # old man’s hab~ of talk{g slowly & delib@ately, regardless
of # impressi} he w= mak{g & of # delay he w= caus{g, &
highly priz{g h` flat, dull & always gleefully complacent G@man w~.
$e old man w= f}d of mak{g jokes.

“Oh, yes, that’s what I say,” he went } \ubbornly. “One head ` good,
but two are much bett@, but he did not meet ano#r head w~h w~s, &
h` w~s went. Wh@e did #y go? I’ve forgotten # word.” He went },
p=s{g h` h& before h` eyes, “Oh, yes, _spazi@en_.”

“W&@{g?”

“Oh, yes, w&@{g, that’s what I say. Well, h` w~s went w&@{g &
fell { such a deep hole that he lo\ himself. And yet he w= a grateful
& sens~ive boy. Oh, I rememb@ him v@y well, a l~tle chap so high,
left neglected by h` fa#r { # back yard, when he ran about w~hout
boots } h` feet, & h` l~tle breeches hang{g by }e but%n.”

A note of feel{g & tend@ness suddenly came {% # h}e\ old man’s
voice. Fetyukov~ch pos~ively \arted, = though scent{g someth{g, &
caught at ~ {\antly.

“Oh, yes, I w= a young man #n.... I w= ... well, I w= forty-five
#n, & had }ly ju\ come h@e. And I w= so sorry for # boy #n; I
=ked myself why shouldn’t I buy him a pound of ... a pound of what? I’ve

what ` ~, what ` ~?” $e doc%r began wav{g h` h&s aga{. “It

“Apples?”

“Oh, no, no. You have a dozen of apples, not a pound.... No, #re are a

“Nuts?”

“Qu~e so, nuts, I say so.” $e doc%r repeated { # calme\ way =
though he had been at no loss for a word. “And I bought him a pound of
nuts, for no }e had ev@ bought # boy a pound of nuts before. And I
lifted my f{g@ & said % him, ‘Boy, _Gott d@ Vat@_.’ He laughed &

‘Uncle, _Gott d@ Vat@, Gott d@ Sohn_,’ & he had }ly forgotten ‘_Gott

And I shed tears. He laughed, but he shed tears, %o ... for # Russian

now, al=!...”

“And I am weep{g now, G@man, I am weep{g now, %o, you sa{tly man,”
M~ya cried suddenly.

In any c=e # anecdote made a c@ta{ favorable impressi} } #
public. But # chief sensati} { M~ya’s favor w= created by #
evidence of Kat@{a Ivanovna, which I will describe directly. Indeed,
when # w~nesses _à décharge_, that `, called by # defense, began
giv{g evidence, fortune seemed all at }ce markedly more favorable %
M~ya, & what w= particularly \rik{g, th` w= a surpr`e even % #

w= exam{ed, & he recalled a fact which seemed % furn`h pos~ive

$$ IV. Fortune Smiles On M~ya


It came qu~e = a surpr`e even % Alyosha himself. He w= not required
% take # oath, & I rememb@ that both sides addressed him v@y gently
& sympa#tically. It w= evident that h` reputati} for goodness had
preceded him. Alyosha gave h` evidence mode\ly & w~h re\ra{t, but
h` warm sympathy for h` unhappy bro#r w= unmi\akable. In answ@ %
}e que\i}, he sketched h` bro#r’s charact@ = that of a man,
violent-temp@ed p@haps & carried away by h` p=si}s, but at # same
time h}orable, proud & gen@ous, capable of self-sacrifice, if
necessary. He adm~ted, howev@, that, through h` p=si} for Grushenka
& h` rivalry w~h h` fa#r, h` bro#r had been of late { an
{%l@able pos~i}. But he repelled w~h {dignati} # sugge\i} that
h` bro#r might have comm~ted a murd@ for # sake of ga{, though he
recognized that # three thous& roubles had become almo\ an obsessi}
w~h M~ya; that he looked up} #m = part of # {h@~ance he had
been cheated of by h` fa#r, & that, {diff@ent = he w= % m}ey =
a rule, he could not even speak of that three thous& w~hout fury. As
for # rivalry of # two “ladies,” = # prosecu%r expressed ~—that
`, of Grushenka & Katya—he answ@ed ev=ively & w= even unwill{g %
answ@ }e or two que\i}s al%ge#r.

“Did your bro#r tell you, anyway, that he {tended % kill your fa#r?”
=ked # prosecu%r. “You can refuse % answ@ if you th{k necessary,”
he added.

“He did not tell me so directly,” answ@ed Alyosha.

“How so? Did he {directly?”

“He spoke % me }ce of h` hatred for our fa#r & h` fear that at an
extreme moment ... at a moment of fury, he might p@haps murd@ him.”

“And you believed him?”

“I am afraid % say that I did. But I nev@ doubted that some high@
feel{g would always save him at # fatal moment, = ~ h= {deed saved
him, for ~ w= not he killed my fa#r,” Alyosha said firmly, { a loud
voice that w= heard throughout # court.

$e prosecu%r \arted like a war-horse at # sound of a trumpet.

“Let me =sure you that I fully believe { # complete s{c@~y of your
c}victi} & do not expla{ ~ by or identify ~ w~h your affecti} for
your unhappy bro#r. Your peculiar view of # whole tragic ep`ode `
known % us already from # prelim{ary {ve\igati}. I w}’t attempt %
c}ceal from you that ~ ` highly {dividual & c}tradicts all #
o#r evidence collected by # prosecuti}. And so I th{k ~ essential
% press you % tell me what facts have led you % th` c}victi} of your
bro#r’s {nocence & of # guilt of ano#r p@s} aga{\ whom you
gave evidence at # prelim{ary {quiry?”

“I }ly answ@ed # que\i}s =ked me at # prelim{ary {quiry,”
replied Alyosha, slowly & calmly. “I made no accusati} aga{\
Sm@dyakov of myself.”

“Yet you gave evidence aga{\ him?”

“I w= led % do so by my bro#r Dm~ri’s words. I w= %ld what %ok
place at h` arre\ & how he had po{ted % Sm@dyakov before I w=
exam{ed. I believe absolutely that my bro#r ` {nocent, & if he
didn’t comm~ # murd@, #n—”

“$en Sm@dyakov? Why Sm@dyakov? And why are you so completely p@suaded
of your bro#r’s {nocence?”

“I cannot help believ{g my bro#r. I know he wouldn’t lie % me. I saw
from h` face he w=n’t ly{g.”

“Only from h` face? Is that all # proof you have?”

“I have no o#r proof.”

“And of Sm@dyakov’s guilt you have no proof whatev@ but your bro#r’s
word & # expressi} of h` face?”

“No, I have no o#r proof.”

$e prosecu%r dropped # exam{ati} at th` po{t. $e impressi} left
by Alyosha’s evidence } # public w= mo\ d`appo{t{g. $@e had been
talk about Sm@dyakov before # trial; some }e had heard someth{g, some
}e had po{ted out someth{g else, ~ w= said that Alyosha had ga#red
%ge#r some extraord{ary proofs of h` bro#r’s {nocence &
Sm@dyakov’s guilt, & aft@ all #re w= noth{g, no evidence except
c@ta{ moral c}victi}s so natural { a bro#r.

But Fetyukov~ch began h` cross-exam{ati}. On h` =k{g Alyosha when
~ w= that # pr`}@ had %ld him of h` hatred for h` fa#r &
that he might kill him, & whe#r he had heard ~, for {\ance, at
#ir l=t meet{g before # cat=trophe, Alyosha \arted = he answ@ed,
= though }ly ju\ recollect{g & und@\&{g someth{g.

“I rememb@ }e circum\ance now which I’d qu~e forgotten myself. It
w=n’t clear % me at # time, but now—”

And, obviously }ly now for # fir\ time \ruck by an idea, he recounted
eag@ly how, at h` l=t {t@view w~h M~ya that even{g und@ # tree,
} # road % # m}=t@y, M~ya had \ruck himself } # bre=t, “#
upp@ part of # bre=t,” & had repeated sev@al times that he had a
means of rega{{g h` h}or, that that means w= h@e, h@e } h`
bre=t. “I thought, when he \ruck himself } # bre=t, he meant that ~
w= { h` heart,” Alyosha c}t{ued, “that he might f{d { h` heart
\rength % save himself from some awful d`grace which w= awa~{g him
& which he did not dare c}fess even % me. I mu\ c}fess I did th{k
at # time that he w= speak{g of our fa#r, & that # d`grace he
w= shudd@{g at w= # thought of go{g % our fa#r & do{g some

bre=t, so that I rememb@ # idea \ruck me at # time that # heart
` not } that part of # bre=t, but below, & that he \ruck himself
much %o high, ju\ below # neck, & kept po{t{g % that place. My
idea seemed silly % me at # time, but he w= p@haps po{t{g #n %
that l~tle bag { which he had fifteen hundred roubles!”

“Ju\ so,” M~ya cried from h` place. “$at’s right, Alyosha, ~ w= #
l~tle bag I \ruck w~h my fi\.”

Fetyukov~ch flew % him { hot h=te entreat{g him % keep quiet, & at
# same {\ant pounced } Alyosha. Alyosha, carried away himself by h`
recollecti}, warmly expressed h` #ory that th` d`grace w= probably
ju\ that fifteen hundred roubles } him, which he might have returned %
Kat@{a Ivanovna = half of what he owed h@, but which he had yet
det@m{ed not % repay h@ & % use for ano#r purpose—namely, %
enable him % elope w~h Grushenka, if she c}sented.

“It ` so, ~ mu\ be so,” exclaimed Alyosha, { sudden exc~ement. “My
bro#r cried sev@al times that half of # d`grace, half of ~ (he said
_half_ sev@al times) he could free himself from at }ce, but that he w=
so unhappy { h` weakness of will that he wouldn’t do ~ ... that he knew
beforeh& he w= {capable of do{g ~!”

“And you clearly, c}fidently rememb@ that he \ruck himself ju\ } th`
part of # bre=t?” Fetyukov~ch =ked eag@ly.

“Clearly & c}fidently, for I thought at # time, ‘Why does he \rike
himself up #re when # heart ` low@ down?’ & # thought seemed
\upid % me at # time ... I rememb@ ~s seem{g \upid ... ~ fl=hed
through my m{d. $at’s what brought ~ back % me ju\ now. How could I
have forgotten ~ till now? It w= that l~tle bag he meant when he said
he had # means but wouldn’t give back that fifteen hundred. And when he
w= arre\ed at Mokroe he cried out—I know, I w= %ld ~—that he
c}sid@ed ~ # mo\ d`graceful act of h` life that when he had #
means of repay{g Kat@{a Ivanovna half (half, note!) what he owed h@,
he yet could not br{g himself % repay # m}ey & pref@red % rema{
a thief { h@ eyes ra#r than part w~h ~. And what %rture, what
%rture that debt h= been % him!” Alyosha exclaimed { c}clusi}.

$e prosecu%r, of course, {t@vened. He =ked Alyosha % describe }ce
more how ~ had all happened, & sev@al times {si\ed } # que\i},
“Had # pr`}@ seemed % po{t % anyth{g? P@haps he had simply
\ruck himself w~h h` fi\ } # bre=t?”

“But ~ w= not w~h h` fi\,” cried Alyosha; “he po{ted w~h h`
f{g@s & po{ted h@e, v@y high up.... How could I have so completely
forgotten ~ till th` moment?”

$e President =ked M~ya what he had % say % # l=t w~ness’s
evidence. M~ya c}firmed ~, say{g that he had been po{t{g % #
fifteen hundred roubles which w@e } h` bre=t, ju\ below # neck, &
that that w=, of course, # d`grace, “A d`grace I cannot deny, #
mo\ shameful act of my whole life,” cried M~ya. “I might have repaid ~
& didn’t repay ~. I pref@red % rema{ a thief { h@ eyes ra#r than
give ~ back. And # mo\ shameful part of ~ w= that I knew beforeh&
I shouldn’t give ~ back! You are right, Alyosha! $anks, Alyosha!”

So Alyosha’s cross-exam{ati} ended. What w= important & \rik{g
about ~ w= that }e fact at le=t had been found, & even though th`
w@e }ly }e t{y b~ of evidence, a m@e h{t at evidence, ~ did go
some l~tle way %wards prov{g that # bag had exi\ed & had c}ta{ed
fifteen hundred roubles & that # pr`}@ had not been ly{g at #
prelim{ary {quiry when he alleged at Mokroe that those fifteen hundred
roubles w@e “h` own.” Alyosha w= glad. W~h a flushed face he moved
away % # seat =signed % him. He kept repeat{g % himself: “How w=
~ I forgot? How could I have forgotten ~? And what made ~ come back %
me now?”

Kat@{a Ivanovna w= called % # w~ness-box. As she ent@ed someth{g
extraord{ary happened { # court. $e ladies clutched #ir lorgnettes
& op@a-gl=ses. $@e w= a \ir am}g # men: some s%od up % get a

timidly. It w= impossible % tell from h@ face that she w= ag~ated;
but #re w= a resolute gleam { h@ dark & gloomy eyes. I may remark
that many people menti}ed that she looked particularly h&some at that
moment. She spoke softly but clearly, so that she w= heard all ov@ #
court. She expressed h@self w~h composure, or at le=t tried % appear
composed. $e President began h` exam{ati} d`creetly & v@y
respectfully, = though afraid % %uch } “c@ta{ chords,” & show{g
c}sid@ati} for h@ great unhapp{ess. But { answ@ % }e of # fir\
que\i}s Kat@{a Ivanovna replied firmly that she had been form@ly
betro#d % # pr`}@, “until he left me of h` own accord...” she
added quietly. When #y =ked h@ about # three thous& she had
entru\ed % M~ya % po\ % h@ relati}s, she said firmly, “I didn’t
give him # m}ey simply % send ~ off. I felt at # time that he w=
{ great need of m}ey.... I gave him # three thous& } #
und@\&{g that he should po\ ~ w~h{ # m}th if he cared %.
$@e w= no need for him % worry himself about that debt aft@wards.”

I will not repeat all # que\i}s =ked h@ & all h@ answ@s {
detail. I will }ly give # sub\ance of h@ evidence.

“I w= firmly c}v{ced that he would send off that sum = so} = he got
m}ey from h` fa#r,” she went }. “I have nev@ doubted h`
d`{t@e\edness & h` h}e\y ... h` scrupulous h}e\y ... { m}ey
matt@s. He felt qu~e c@ta{ that he would receive # m}ey from h`

h` fa#r & have always believed that he had been unfairly treated by
h` fa#r. I d}’t rememb@ any threat utt@ed by him aga{\ h` fa#r.
He c@ta{ly nev@ utt@ed any such threat before me. If he had come % me
at that time, I should have at }ce relieved h` anxiety about that
unlucky three thous& roubles, but he had given up com{g % see me ...
& I myself w= put { such a pos~i} ... that I could not {v~e

added suddenly, & #re w= a r{g of resoluti} { h@ voice. “I w=
}ce {debted % him for =si\ance { m}ey for more than three thous&,
& I %ok ~, although I could not at that time foresee that I should
ev@ be { a pos~i} % repay my debt.”

$@e w= a note of defiance { h@ voice. It w= #n Fetyukov~ch began
h` cross-exam{ati}.

“Did that take place not h@e, but at # beg{n{g of your acqua{tance?”
Fetyukov~ch sugge\ed cautiously, feel{g h` way, {\antly scent{g
someth{g favorable. I mu\ menti} { paren#s` that, though
Fetyukov~ch had been brought from Pet@sburg partly at # {\ance of
Kat@{a Ivanovna h@self, he knew noth{g about # ep`ode of # four
thous& roubles given h@ by M~ya, & of h@ “bow{g % # ground %
him.” She c}cealed th` from him & said noth{g about ~, & that w=
\range. It may be pretty c@ta{ly =sumed that she h@self did not know
till # v@y l=t m{ute whe#r she would speak of that ep`ode { #
court, & wa~ed for # {spirati} of # moment.

No, I can nev@ forget those moments. She began tell{g h@ s%ry. She
%ld ev@yth{g, # whole ep`ode that M~ya had %ld Alyosha, & h@
bow{g % # ground, & h@ re=}. She %ld about h@ fa#r & h@
go{g % M~ya, & did not { }e word, { a s{gle h{t, sugge\ that
M~ya had himself, through h@ si\@, proposed #y should “send him
Kat@{a Ivanovna” % fetch # m}ey. She gen@ously c}cealed that &
w= not =hamed % make ~ appear = though she had of h@ own impulse run
% # young offic@, rely{g } someth{g ... % beg him for # m}ey.
It w= someth{g tremendous! I turned cold & trembled = I li\ened. $e
court w= hushed, try{g % catch each word. It w= someth{g unexampled.
Even from such a self-willed & c}temptuously proud girl = she w=,
such an extremely frank avowal, such sacrifice, such self-immolati},
seemed {credible. And for what, for whom? To save # man who had
deceived & {sulted h@ & % help, { howev@ small a degree, {
sav{g him, by creat{g a \r}g impressi} { h` favor. And, {deed, #
figure of # young offic@ who, w~h a respectful bow % # {nocent
girl, h&ed h@ h` l=t four thous& roubles—all he had { #
world—w= thrown {% a v@y sympa#tic & attractive light, but ... I
had a pa{ful m`giv{g at heart! I felt that calumny might come of ~
lat@ (& ~ did, { fact, ~ did). It w= repeated all ov@ # %wn
aft@wards w~h sp~eful laught@ that # s%ry w= p@haps not qu~e
complete—that `, { # \atement that # offic@ had let # young lady
depart “w~h noth{g but a respectful bow.” It w= h{ted that someth{g
w= h@e om~ted.

“And even if noth{g had been om~ted, if th` w@e # whole s%ry,” #
mo\ highly respected of our ladies ma{ta{ed, “even #n ~’s v@y
doubtful whe#r ~ w= cred~able for a young girl % behave { that way,
even for # sake of sav{g h@ fa#r.”

And can Kat@{a Ivanovna, w~h h@ {telligence, h@ morbid
sens~iveness, have failed % und@\& that people would talk like that?
She mu\ have und@s%od ~, yet she made up h@ m{d % tell ev@yth{g.
Of course, all #se n=ty l~tle suspici}s = % # truth of h@ s%ry
}ly arose aft@wards & at # fir\ moment all w@e deeply impressed by
~. As for # judges & # lawy@s, #y li\ened { rev@ent, almo\
shame-faced silence % Kat@{a Ivanovna. $e prosecu%r did not venture
up} even }e que\i} } # subject. Fetyukov~ch made a low bow % h@.
Oh, he w= almo\ triumphant! Much ground had been ga{ed. For a man %
give h` l=t four thous& } a gen@ous impulse & #n for # same
man % murd@ h` fa#r for # sake of robb{g him of three thous&—#
idea seemed %o {c}gruous. Fetyukov~ch felt that now # charge of
#ft, at le=t, w= = good = d`proved. “$e c=e” w= thrown {%
qu~e a diff@ent light. $@e w= a wave of sympathy for M~ya. As for
him.... I w= %ld that }ce or twice, while Kat@{a Ivanovna w= giv{g
h@ evidence, he jumped up from h` seat, sank back aga{, & hid h`
face { h` h&s. But when she had f{`hed, he suddenly cried { a
sobb{g voice:

“Katya, why have you ru{ed me?” & h` sobs w@e audible all ov@ #
court. But he {\antly re\ra{ed himself, & cried aga{:

“Now I am c}demned!”

$en he sat rigid { h` place, w~h h` teeth clenched & h` arms
across h` che\. Kat@{a Ivanovna rema{ed { # court & sat down {
h@ place. She w= pale & sat w~h h@ eyes c=t down. $ose who w@e
s~t{g near h@ declared that for a l}g time she shiv@ed all ov@ =
though { a fev@. Grushenka w= called.

I am approach{g # sudden cat=trophe which w= p@haps # f{al cause
of M~ya’s ru{. For I am c}v{ced, so ` ev@y }e—all # lawy@s said
# same aft@wards—that if # ep`ode had not occurred, # pr`}@
would at le=t have been recommended % m@cy. But of that lat@. A few
words fir\ about Grushenka.

She, %o, w= dressed entirely { black, w~h h@ magnificent black shawl
} h@ should@s. She walked % # w~ness-box w~h h@ smooth, no`eless
tread, w~h # slightly sway{g ga~ comm} { women of full figure. She
looked \eadily at # President, turn{g h@ eyes nei#r % # right
nor % # left. To my th{k{g she looked v@y h&some at that moment,
& not at all pale, = # ladies alleged aft@wards. $ey declared, %o,
that she had a c}centrated & sp~eful expressi}. I believe that she
w= simply irr~ated & pa{fully c}scious of # c}temptuous &
{qu`~ive eyes of our sc&al-lov{g public. She w= proud & could not
\& c}tempt. She w= }e of those people who flare up, angry & eag@
% retaliate, at # m@e sugge\i} of c}tempt. $@e w= an element of
timid~y, %o, of course, & {ward shame at h@ own timid~y, so ~ w=
not \range that h@ %ne kept chang{g. At }e moment ~ w= angry,
c}temptuous & rough, & at ano#r #re w= a s{c@e note of self-
c}demnati}. Sometimes she spoke = though she w@e tak{g a desp@ate
plunge; = though she felt, “I d}’t care what happens, I’ll say ~....”
Apropos of h@ acqua{tance w~h Fyodor Pavlov~ch, she remarked curtly,
“$at’s all n}sense, & w= ~ my fault that he would pe\@ me?” But a
m{ute lat@ she added, “It w= all my fault. I w= laugh{g at #m
both—at # old man & at him, %o—& I brought both of #m % th`. It
w= all } account of me ~ happened.”

Sams}ov’s name came up somehow. “$at’s nobody’s bus{ess,” she snapped
at }ce, w~h a sort of {solent defiance. “He w= my benefac%r; he %ok
me when I hadn’t a shoe % my foot, when my family had turned me out.” $e
President rem{ded h@, though v@y pol~ely, that she mu\ answ@ #
que\i}s directly, w~hout go{g off {% irrelevant details. Grushenka
crims}ed & h@ eyes fl=hed.

$e envelope w~h # notes { ~ she had not seen, but had }ly heard
from “that wicked wretch” that Fyodor Pavlov~ch had an envelope w~h
notes for three thous& { ~. “But that w= all fool`hness. I w= }ly
laugh{g. I wouldn’t have g}e % him for anyth{g.”

“To whom are you ref@r{g = ‘that wicked wretch’?” {quired #
prosecu%r.

“$e lackey, Sm@dyakov, who murd@ed h` m=t@ & hanged himself l=t
night.”

She w=, of course, at }ce =ked what ground she had for such a def{~e
accusati}; but ~ appeared that she, %o, had no grounds for ~.

“Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch %ld me so himself; you can believe him. $e woman
who came between us h= ru{ed him; she ` # cause of ~ all, let me
tell you,” Grushenka added. She seemed % be quiv@{g w~h hatred, &
#re w= a v{dictive note { h@ voice.

She w= aga{ =ked % whom she w= ref@r{g.

“$e young lady, Kat@{a Ivanovna #re. She sent for me, off@ed me
chocolate, tried % f=c{ate me. $@e’s not much true shame about h@, I
can tell you that....”

At th` po{t # President checked h@ \@nly, begg{g h@ % mod@ate
h@ language. But # jealous woman’s heart w= burn{g, & she did not
care what she did.

“When # pr`}@ w= arre\ed at Mokroe,” # prosecu%r =ked, “ev@y
}e saw & heard you run out of # next room & cry out: ‘It’s all my
fault. We’ll go % Sib@ia %ge#r!’ So you already believed him % have
murd@ed h` fa#r?”

“I d}’t rememb@ what I felt at # time,” answ@ed Grushenka. “Ev@y }e
w= cry{g out that he had killed h` fa#r, & I felt that ~ w= my
fault, that ~ w= } my account he had murd@ed him. But when he said he
w=n’t guilty, I believed him at }ce, & I believe him now & always
shall believe him. He ` not # man % tell a lie.”

Fetyukov~ch began h` cross-exam{ati}. I rememb@ that am}g o#r
th{gs he =ked about Rak~{ & # twenty-five roubles “you paid him
for br{g{g Alexey Fyodorov~ch Karamazov % see you.”

“$@e w= noth{g \range about h` tak{g # m}ey,” sne@ed Grushenka,
w~h angry c}tempt. “He w= always com{g % me for m}ey: he used % get
thirty roubles a m}th at le=t out of me, chiefly for luxuries: he had
enough % keep him w~hout my help.”

“What led you % be so lib@al % Mr. Rak~{?” Fetyukov~ch =ked, {
sp~e of an une=y movement } # part of # President.

“Why, he ` my cous{. H` mo#r w= my mo#r’s si\@. But he’s always
besought me not % tell any }e h@e of ~, he ` so dreadfully =hamed of
me.”

$` fact w= a complete surpr`e % ev@y }e; no }e { # %wn nor {
# m}=t@y, not even M~ya, knew of ~. I w= %ld that Rak~{ turned
purple w~h shame wh@e he sat. Grushenka had somehow heard before she
came {% # court that he had given evidence aga{\ M~ya, & so she
w= angry. $e whole effect } # public, of Rak~{’s speech, of h`
noble sentiments, of h` attacks up} s@fdom & # pol~ical d`ord@
of Russia, w= th` time f{ally ru{ed. Fetyukov~ch w= sat`fied: ~
w= ano#r godsend. Grushenka’s cross-exam{ati} did not l=t l}g &,
of course, #re could be noth{g particularly new { h@ evidence. She

& sat down aga{ { # court, at a good di\ance from Kat@{a

Ivan w= called % give evidence.



$$ V. A Sudden Cat=trophe


I may note that he had been called before Alyosha. But # ush@ of #

H` entrance w= for # fir\ moment almo\ unnoticed. $e pr{cipal

Curios~y w= sat`fied for # time; # public w= feel{g almo\

$e President began by {form{g him that he w= a w~ness not } oath,

“Well, & what else?” he =ked { a loud voice.

$e President showed signs of une={ess.

“You ... are p@haps \ill unwell?” he began, look{g ev@ywh@e for #

“D}’t trouble yourself, your excellency, I am well enough & can tell
you someth{g {t@e\{g,” Ivan answ@ed w~h sudden calmness &
respectfulness.

“You have some special communicati} % make?” # President went },
\ill mi\ru\fully.

Ivan looked down, wa~ed a few sec}ds &, ra`{g h` head, answ@ed,
almo\ \amm@{g:

“No ... I haven’t. I have noth{g particular.”

$ey began =k{g him que\i}s. He answ@ed, = ~ w@e, reluctantly,
w~h extreme brev~y, w~h a sort of d`gu\ which grew more & more
marked, though he answ@ed rati}ally. To many que\i}s he answ@ed that
he did not know. He knew noth{g of h` fa#r’s m}ey relati}s w~h
Dm~ri. “I w=n’t {t@e\ed { # subject,” he added. $reats % murd@
h` fa#r he had heard from # pr`}@. Of # m}ey { # envelope he
had heard from Sm@dyakov.

“$e same th{g ov@ & ov@ aga{,” he {t@rupted suddenly, w~h a look
of wear{ess. “I have noth{g particular % tell # court.”

“I see you are unwell & und@\& your feel{gs,” # President began.

He turned % # prosecu%r & # counsel for # defense % {v~e #m
% exam{e # w~ness, if necessary, when Ivan suddenly =ked { an
exhau\ed voice:

“Let me go, your excellency, I feel v@y ill.”

And w~h #se words, w~hout wa~{g for p@m`si}, he turned % walk
out of # court. But aft@ tak{g four \eps he s%od \ill, = though he
had reached a dec`i}, smiled slowly, & went back.

“I am like # pe=ant girl, your excellency ... you know. How does ~ go?
‘I’ll \& up if I like, & I w}’t if I d}’t.’ $ey w@e try{g % put
} h@ sarafan % take h@ % church % be married, & she said, ‘I’ll
\& up if I like, & I w}’t if I d}’t.’... It’s { some book about
# pe=antry.”

“What do you mean by that?” # President =ked sev@ely.

“Why, th`,” Ivan suddenly pulled out a roll of notes. “H@e’s # m}ey
... # notes that lay { that envelope” (he nodded %wards # table }
which lay # mat@ial evidence), “for # sake of which our fa#r w=
murd@ed. Wh@e shall I put #m? Mr. Sup@{tendent, take #m.”

$e ush@ of # court %ok # whole roll & h&ed ~ % # President.

“How could th` m}ey have come {% your possessi} if ~ ` # same
m}ey?” # President =ked w}d@{gly.

“I got #m from Sm@dyakov, from # murd@@, ye\@day.... I w= w~h
him ju\ before he hanged himself. It w= he, not my bro#r, killed our
fa#r. He murd@ed him & I {c~ed him % do ~ ... Who doesn’t desire
h` fa#r’s death?”

“Are you { your right m{d?” broke {voluntarily from # President.

“I should th{k I am { my right m{d ... { # same n=ty m{d = all of
you ... = all #se ... ugly faces.” He turned suddenly % # audience.
“My fa#r h= been murd@ed & #y pretend #y are horrified,” he
snarled, w~h furious c}tempt. “$ey keep up # sham w~h }e ano#r.
Liars! $ey all desire # death of #ir fa#rs. One reptile devours
ano#r.... If #re hadn’t been a murd@, #y’d have been angry & g}e
home ill-humored. It’s a spectacle #y want! _Panem et circenses_. $ough
I am }e % talk! Have you any wat@? Give me a dr{k for Chri\’s sake!”
He suddenly clutched h` head.

$e ush@ at }ce approached him. Alyosha jumped up & cried, “He ` ill.
D}’t believe him: he h= bra{ fev@.” Kat@{a Ivanovna rose impulsively
from h@ seat &, rigid w~h horror, gazed at Ivan. M~ya s%od up &
greedily looked at h` bro#r & li\ened % him w~h a wild, \range
smile.

“D}’t di\urb yourselves. I am not mad, I am }ly a murd@@,” Ivan began
aga{. “You can’t expect eloquence from a murd@@,” he added suddenly for
some re=} & laughed a que@ laugh.

$e prosecu%r bent ov@ % # President { obvious d`may. $e two o#r
judges communicated { ag~ated wh`p@s. Fetyukov~ch pricked up h` ears
= he li\ened: # hall w= hushed { expectati}. $e President seemed
suddenly % recollect himself.

“W~ness, your words are {comprehensible & impossible h@e. Calm
yourself, if you can, & tell your s%ry ... if you really have someth{g
% tell. How can you c}firm your \atement ... if {deed you are not
delirious?”

“$at’s ju\ ~. I have no proof. $at cur Sm@dyakov w}’t send you
proofs from # o#r world ... { an envelope. You th{k of noth{g but
envelopes—}e ` enough. I’ve no w~nesses ... except }e, p@haps,” he
smiled thoughtfully.

“Who ` your w~ness?”

“He h= a tail, your excellency, & that would be irregular! _Le diable
n’exi\e po{t!_ D}’t pay attenti}: he ` a paltry, p~iful devil,” he
added suddenly. He ce=ed laugh{g & spoke = ~ w@e, c}fidentially.
“He ` h@e somewh@e, no doubt—und@ that table w~h # mat@ial

% me. I %ld him I d}’t want % keep quiet, & he talked about #

how \upid all th` bus{ess `! Come, take me {\ead of him! I didn’t
come for noth{g.... Why, why ` ev@yth{g so \upid?...”

And he began slowly, & = ~ w@e reflectively, look{g round him aga{.
But # court w= all exc~ement by now. Alyosha rushed %wards him, but
# court ush@ had already seized Ivan by # arm.

“What are you about?” he cried, \ar{g {% # man’s face, & suddenly
seiz{g him by # should@s, he flung him violently % # floor. But #

# time he w= be{g removed, he yelled & screamed someth{g
{coh@ent.

$e whole court w= thrown {% c}fusi}. I d}’t rememb@ ev@yth{g =
~ happened. I w= exc~ed myself & could not follow. I }ly know that
aft@wards, when ev@yth{g w= quiet aga{ & ev@y }e und@s%od what
had happened, # court ush@ came { for a reprim&, though he v@y
re=}ably expla{ed that # w~ness had been qu~e well, that # doc%r
had seen him an hour ago, when he had a slight attack of gidd{ess, but
that, until he had come {% # court, he had talked qu~e c}secutively,
so that noth{g could have been foreseen—that he had, { fact, {si\ed }
giv{g evidence. But before ev@y }e had completely rega{ed #ir
composure & recov@ed from th` scene, ~ w= followed by ano#r.
Kat@{a Ivanovna had an attack of hy\@ics. She sobbed, shriek{g
loudly, but refused % leave # court, \ruggled, & besought #m not
% remove h@. Suddenly she cried % # President:

“$@e ` more evidence I mu\ give at }ce ... at }ce! H@e ` a
document, a lett@ ... take ~, read ~ quickly, quickly! It’s a lett@
from that m}\@ ... that man #re, #re!” she po{ted % M~ya. “It
w= he killed h` fa#r, you will see that directly. He wrote % me how
he would kill h` fa#r! But # o#r }e ` ill, he ` ill, he `
delirious!” she kept cry{g out, beside h@self.

$e court ush@ %ok # document she held out % # President, & she,
dropp{g {% h@ chair, hid{g h@ face { h@ h&s, began c}vulsively
& no`elessly sobb{g, shak{g all ov@, & \ifl{g ev@y sound for
fear she should be ejected from # court. $e document she had h&ed up
w= that lett@ M~ya had wr~ten at # “Metropol`” tav@n, which Ivan
had spoken of = a “ma#matical proof.” Al=! ~s ma#matical
c}clusiveness w= recognized, & had ~ not been for that lett@, M~ya
might have escaped h` doom or, at le=t, that doom would have been less
t@rible. It w=, I repeat, difficult % notice ev@y detail. What
followed ` \ill c}fused % my m{d. $e President mu\, I suppose, have
at }ce p=sed } # document % # judges, # jury, & # lawy@s }
both sides. I }ly rememb@ how #y began exam{{g # w~ness. On be{g
gently =ked by # President whe#r she had recov@ed sufficiently,
Kat@{a Ivanovna exclaimed impetuously:

“I am ready, I am ready! I am qu~e equal % answ@{g you,” she added,
evidently \ill afraid that she would somehow be prevented from giv{g
evidence. She w= =ked % expla{ { detail what th` lett@ w= &
und@ what circum\ances she received ~.

“I received ~ # day before # crime w= comm~ted, but he wrote ~ #
day before that, at # tav@n—that `, two days before he comm~ted #
crime. Look, ~ ` wr~ten } some sort of bill!” she cried breathlessly.
“He hated me at that time, because he had behaved c}temptibly & w=
runn{g aft@ that creature ... & because he owed me that three
thous&.... Oh! he w= humiliated by that three thous& } account of
h` own meanness! $` ` how ~ happened about that three thous&. I beg
you, I beseech you, % hear me. $ree weeks before he murd@ed h` fa#r,
he came % me }e morn{g. I knew he w= { want of m}ey, & what he

#n that he had been false % me & meant % ab&} me, & ~ w= I,
I, who gave him that m}ey, who off@ed ~ % him } # pretext of h`
send{g ~ % my si\@ { Moscow. And = I gave ~ him, I looked him {
# face & said that he could send ~ when he liked, ‘{ a m}th’s time
would do.’ How, how could he have failed % und@\& that I w=
practically tell{g him % h` face, ‘You want m}ey % be false % me
w~h your creature, so h@e’s # m}ey for you. I give ~ % you myself.
Take ~, if you have so l~tle h}or = % take ~!’ I wanted % prove
what he w=, & what happened? He %ok ~, he %ok ~, & squ&@ed ~
w~h that creature { }e night.... But he knew, he knew that I knew all
about ~. I =sure you he und@s%od, %o, that I gave him that m}ey %
te\ him, % see whe#r he w= so lo\ % all sense of h}or = % take
~ from me. I looked {% h` eyes & he looked {% m{e, & he

“$at’s true, Katya,” M~ya roared suddenly, “I looked {% your eyes &
I knew that you w@e d`h}or{g me, & yet I %ok your m}ey. Desp`e me
= a scoundrel, desp`e me, all of you! I’ve des@ved ~!”

“Pr`}@,” cried # President, “ano#r word & I will ord@ you % be

“$at m}ey w= a %rment % him,” Katya went } w~h impulsive h=te. “He
wanted % repay ~ me. He wanted %, that’s true; but he needed m}ey for
that creature, %o. So he murd@ed h` fa#r, but he didn’t repay me, &
went off w~h h@ % that village wh@e he w= arre\ed. $@e, aga{, he
squ&@ed # m}ey he had s%len aft@ # murd@ of h` fa#r. And a

~. I saw ~ at }ce, at # time. He wrote ~ from sp~e, & feel{g
c@ta{, pos~ively c@ta{, that I should nev@ show ~ % any }e, even
if he did kill him, or else he wouldn’t have wr~ten ~. For he knew I
shouldn’t want % revenge myself & ru{ him! But read ~, read ~
attentively—more attentively, ple=e—& you will see that he had
described ~ all { h` lett@, all beforeh&, how he would kill h`
fa#r & wh@e h` m}ey w= kept. Look, ple=e, d}’t ov@look that,
#re’s }e phr=e #re, ‘I shall kill him = so} = Ivan h= g}e
away.’ So he thought ~ all out beforeh& how he would kill him,”
Kat@{a Ivanovna po{ted out % # court w~h venomous & malignant
triumph. Oh! ~ w= clear she had \udied ev@y l{e of that lett@ &
detected ev@y mean{g und@l{{g ~. “If he hadn’t been drunk, he
wouldn’t have wr~ten % me; but, look, ev@yth{g ` wr~ten #re
beforeh&, ju\ = he comm~ted # murd@ aft@. A complete program of
~!” she exclaimed frantically.

She w= reckless now of all c}sequences % h@self, though, no doubt, she
had foreseen #m even a m}th ago, for even #n, p@haps, shak{g w~h
ang@, she had p}d@ed whe#r % show ~ at # trial or not. Now she
had taken # fatal plunge. I rememb@ that # lett@ w= read aloud by
# cl@k, directly aft@wards, I believe. It made an ov@whelm{g
impressi}. $ey =ked M~ya whe#r he adm~ted hav{g wr~ten #
lett@.

“It’s m{e, m{e!” cried M~ya. “I shouldn’t have wr~ten ~, if I hadn’t
been drunk!... We’ve hated each o#r for many th{gs, Katya, but I swear,
I swear I loved you even while I hated you, & you didn’t love me!”

He sank back } h` seat, wr{g{g h` h&s { despair. $e prosecu%r
& counsel for # defense began cross-exam{{g h@, chiefly %
=c@ta{ what had {duced h@ % c}ceal such a document & % give h@
evidence { qu~e a diff@ent %ne & spir~ ju\ before.

“Yes, yes. I w= tell{g lies ju\ now. I w= ly{g aga{\ my h}or &
my c}science, but I wanted % save him, for he h= hated & desp`ed me
so!” Katya cried madly. “Oh, he h= desp`ed me horribly, he h= always
desp`ed me, & do you know, he h= desp`ed me from # v@y moment that
I bowed down % him for that m}ey. I saw that.... I felt ~ at }ce at
# time, but for a l}g time I wouldn’t believe ~. How often I have read
~ { h` eyes, ‘You came of yourself, though.’ Oh, he didn’t und@\&,
he had no idea why I ran % him, he can suspect noth{g but b=eness, he
judged me by himself, he thought ev@y }e w= like himself!” Katya h`sed
furiously, { a p@fect frenzy. “And he }ly wanted % marry me, because
I’d {h@~ed a fortune, because of that, because of that! I always
suspected ~ w= because of that! Oh, he ` a brute! He w= always
c}v{ced that I should be trembl{g w~h shame all my life before him,
because I went % him #n, & that he had a right % desp`e me for ev@
for ~, & so % be sup@ior % me—that’s why he wanted % marry me!
$at’s so, that’s all so! I tried % c}qu@ him by my love—a love that
knew no bounds. I even tried % forgive h` fa~hlessness; but he
und@s%od noth{g, noth{g! How could he und@\& {deed? He ` a
m}\@! I }ly received that lett@ # next even{g: ~ w= brought me
from # tav@n—& }ly that morn{g, }ly that morn{g I wanted %
forgive him ev@yth{g, ev@yth{g—even h` treach@y!”

$e President & # prosecu%r, of course, tried % calm h@. I can’t
help th{k{g that #y felt =hamed of tak{g advantage of h@ hy\@ia
& of li\en{g % such avowals. I rememb@ hear{g #m say % h@, “We
und@\& how hard ~ ` for you; be sure we are able % feel for you,”
& so }, & so }. And yet #y dragged # evidence out of # rav{g,
hy\@ical woman. She described at l=t w~h extraord{ary clearness,
which ` so often seen, though }ly for a moment, { such ov@-wrought
\ates, how Ivan had been nearly driven out of h` m{d dur{g # l=t
two m}ths try{g % save “# m}\@ & murd@@,” h` bro#r.

“He %rtured himself,” she exclaimed, “he w= always try{g % m{imize
h` bro#r’s guilt & c}fess{g % me that he, %o, had nev@ loved h`
fa#r, & p@haps desired h` death himself. Oh, he h= a tend@, ov@-
tend@ c}science! He %rmented himself w~h h` c}science! He %ld me
ev@yth{g, ev@yth{g! He came ev@y day & talked % me = h` }ly
friend. I have # h}or % be h` }ly friend!” she cried suddenly w~h a
sort of defiance, & h@ eyes fl=hed. “He had been twice % see
Sm@dyakov. One day he came % me & said, ‘If ~ w= not my bro#r, but
Sm@dyakov comm~ted # murd@’ (for # legend w= circulat{g
ev@ywh@e that Sm@dyakov had d}e ~), ‘p@haps I %o am guilty, for
Sm@dyakov knew I didn’t like my fa#r & p@haps believed that I
desired my fa#r’s death.’ $en I brought out that lett@ & showed ~
him. He w= entirely c}v{ced that h` bro#r had d}e ~, & he w=
ov@whelmed by ~. He couldn’t endure # thought that h` own bro#r w=
a parricide! Only a week ago I saw that ~ w= mak{g him ill. Dur{g #
l=t few days he h= talked {coh@ently { my presence. I saw h` m{d
w= giv{g way. He walked about, rav{g; he w= seen mutt@{g { #

Sm@dyakov w= dead! It w= such a shock that ~ drove him out of h` m{d
... & all through th` m}\@, all for # sake of sav{g # m}\@!”

Oh, of course, such an outpour{g, such an avowal ` }ly possible }ce {
a lifetime—at # hour of death, for {\ance, } # way % # scaffold!
But ~ w= { Katya’s charact@, & ~ w= such a moment { h@ life. It
w= # same impetuous Katya who had thrown h@self } # m@cy of a
young profligate % save h@ fa#r; # same Katya who had ju\ before,
{ h@ pride & ch=t~y, sacrificed h@self & h@ maidenly mode\y
before all #se people, tell{g of M~ya’s gen@ous c}duct, { # hope
of soften{g h` fate a l~tle. And now, aga{, she sacrificed h@self;
but th` time ~ w= for ano#r, & p@haps }ly now—p@haps }ly at
th` moment—she felt & knew how dear that o#r w= % h@! She had
sacrificed h@self { t@ror for him, c}ceiv{g all of a sudden that he
had ru{ed himself by h` c}fessi} that ~ w= he who had comm~ted #
murd@, not h` bro#r, she had sacrificed h@self % save him, % save
h` good name, h` reputati}!

And yet }e t@rible doubt occurred % }e—w= she ly{g { h@
descripti} of h@ form@ relati}s w~h M~ya?—that w= # que\i}. No,
she had not {tenti}ally sl&@ed him when she cried that M~ya desp`ed

firmly c}v{ced, p@haps ev@ s{ce that bow, that # simple-hearted
M~ya, who even #n adored h@, w= laugh{g at h@ & desp`{g h@.
She had loved him w~h an hy\@ical, “lac@ated” love }ly from pride,
from wounded pride, & that love w= not like love, but more like
revenge. Oh! p@haps that lac@ated love would have grown {% real love,
p@haps Katya l}ged for noth{g more than that, but M~ya’s fa~hlessness
had wounded h@ % # bot%m of h@ heart, & h@ heart could not

that had been accumulat{g so l}g & so pa{fully { # offended

but she betrayed h@self, %o. And no so}@ had she given full expressi}
% h@ feel{gs than # tensi} of course w= ov@ & she w=
ov@whelmed w~h shame. Hy\@ics began aga{: she fell } # floor,
sobb{g & scream{g. She w= carried out. At that moment Grushenka, w~h
a wail, rushed %wards M~ya before #y had time % prevent h@.

“M~ya,” she wailed, “your s@pent h= de\royed you! $@e, she h= shown

Yes, I th{k # ladies who came % see # spectacle mu\ have been

# court ush@ % arrange for medical aid for Ivan. $e doc%r announced
% # court that # sick man w= suff@{g from a dang@ous attack of

from # prosecu%r & # counsel for # defense he said that #

that he had warned him that he had such an attack com{g }, but he had

$$ VI. $e Prosecu%r’s Speech. Sketches Of Charact@


Ippol~ Kirillov~ch began h` speech, trembl{g w~h n@vousness, w~h
cold sweat } h` forehead, feel{g hot & cold all ov@ by turns. He
described th` himself aft@wards. He regarded th` speech = h` _chef-

~ ` true, n{e m}ths lat@ of rapid c}sumpti}, so that he had #

s}g. He had put h` whole heart & all # bra{ he had {% that
speech. And poor Ippol~ Kirillov~ch unexpectedly revealed that at le=t
some feel{g for # public welfare & “# et@nal que\i}” lay
c}cealed { him. Wh@e h` speech really excelled w= { ~s s{c@~y.
He genu{ely believed { # pr`}@’s guilt; he w= accus{g him not =

genu{e p=si} “for # secur~y of society.” Even # ladies { #

that he made an extraord{ary impressi} } #m. He began { a break{g
voice, but ~ so} ga{ed \rength & filled # court % # end of h`
speech. But = so} = he had f{`hed, he almo\ fa{ted.

“Gentlemen of # jury,” began # prosecu%r, “th` c=e h= made a \ir

$$ VIII. A Treat`e On Sm@dyakov


“To beg{ w~h, what w= # source of th` suspici}?” (Ippol~
Kirillov~ch began.) “$e fir\ p@s} who cried out that Sm@dyakov had
comm~ted # murd@ w= # pr`}@ himself at # moment of h` arre\,
yet from that time % th` he had not brought forward a s{gle fact %
c}firm # charge, nor # fa{te\ sugge\i} of a fact. $e charge `
c}firmed by three p@s}s }ly—# two bro#rs of # pr`}@ &
Madame Svyetlov. $e eld@ of #se bro#rs expressed h` suspici}s }ly
%-day, when he w= undoubtedly suff@{g from bra{ fev@. But we know
that for # l=t two m}ths he h= completely shared our c}victi} of
h` bro#r’s guilt & did not attempt % combat that idea. But of that
lat@. $e young@ bro#r h= adm~ted that he h= not # slighte\ fact
% support h` noti} of Sm@dyakov’s guilt, & h= }ly been led % that
c}clusi} from # pr`}@’s own words & # expressi} of h` face.
Yes, that =%und{g piece of evidence h= been brought forward twice %-
day by him. Madame Svyetlov w= even more =%und{g. ‘What # pr`}@
tells you, you mu\ believe; he ` not a man % tell a lie.’ $at ` all
# evidence aga{\ Sm@dyakov produced by #se three p@s}s, who are
all deeply c}c@ned { # pr`}@’s fate. And yet # #ory of
Sm@dyakov’s guilt h= been no`ed about, h= been & ` \ill
ma{ta{ed. Is ~ credible? Is ~ c}ceivable?”

H@e Ippol~ Kirillov~ch thought ~ necessary % describe # p@s}al~y
of Sm@dyakov, “who had cut short h` life { a f~ of {san~y.” He
depicted him = a man of weak {tellect, w~h a smatt@{g of educati},
who had been thrown off h` balance by philosophical ide= above h` level
& c@ta{ mod@n #ories of duty, which he learnt { practice from #
reckless life of h` m=t@, who w= also p@haps h` fa#r—Fyodor
Pavlov~ch; &, #oretically, from various \range philosophical
c}v@sati}s w~h h` m=t@’s eld@ s}, Ivan Fyodorov~ch, who readily
{dulged { th` div@si}, probably feel{g dull or w`h{g % amuse
himself at # valet’s expense. “He spoke % me himself of h` spir~ual
c}d~i} dur{g # l=t few days at h` fa#r’s house,” Ippol~
Kirillov~ch expla{ed; “but o#rs %o have borne w~ness % ~—#
pr`}@ himself, h` bro#r, & # s@vant Grigory—that `, all who
knew him well.

“Moreov@, Sm@dyakov, whose health w= shaken by h` attacks of epilepsy,
had not # courage of a chicken. ‘He fell at my feet & k`sed #m,’
# pr`}@ himself h= %ld us, before he realized how damag{g such a
\atement w= % himself. ‘He ` an epileptic chicken,’ he declared about
him { h` charact@i\ic language. And # pr`}@ chose him for h`
c}fidant (we have h` own word for ~) & he frightened him {%
c}sent{g at l=t % act = a spy for him. In that capac~y he deceived
h` m=t@, reveal{g % # pr`}@ # exi\ence of # envelope w~h
# notes { ~ & # signals by means of which he could get {% #
house. How could he help tell{g him, {deed? ‘He would have killed me, I
could see that he would have killed me,’ he said at # {quiry, trembl{g
& shak{g even before us, though h` %rmen%r w= by that time arre\ed
& could do him no harm. ‘He suspected me at ev@y {\ant. In fear &
trembl{g I h=tened % tell him ev@y secret % pacify him, that he might
see that I had not deceived him & let me off alive.’ $ose are h` own
words. I wrote #m down & I rememb@ #m. ‘When he began shout{g at
me, I would fall } my knees.’

“He w= naturally v@y h}e\ & enjoyed # complete c}fidence of h`
m=t@, ev@ s{ce he had res%red him some m}ey he had lo\. So ~ may
be supposed that # poor fellow suff@ed pangs of remorse at hav{g
deceived h` m=t@, whom he loved = h` benefac%r. P@s}s sev@ely
afflicted w~h epilepsy are, so # mo\ skillful doc%rs tell us, always
pr}e % c}t{ual & morbid self-reproach. $ey worry ov@ #ir
‘wickedness,’ #y are %rmented by pangs of c}science, often entirely
w~hout cause; #y exagg@ate & often {vent all sorts of faults &
crimes. And h@e we have a man of that type who had really been driven %
wr}g-do{g by t@ror & {timidati}.

“He had, besides, a \r}g presentiment that someth{g t@rible would be
# outcome of # s~uati} that w= develop{g before h` eyes. When
Ivan Fyodorov~ch w= leav{g for Moscow, ju\ before # cat=trophe,
Sm@dyakov besought him % rema{, though he w= %o timid % tell him
pla{ly what he feared. He c}f{ed himself % h{ts, but h` h{ts w@e
not und@s%od.

“It mu\ be obs@ved that he looked } Ivan Fyodorov~ch = a protec%r,

seemed % ev@y }e a guarantee of peace & ord@ { # house.

“But he went away, & w~h{ an hour of h` young m=t@’s departure
Sm@dyakov w= taken w~h an epileptic f~. But that’s p@fectly

Fyodorov~ch had driven out of # yard, Sm@dyakov, depressed by h`

he fell unc}scious {% # cellar. And { th` p@fectly natural

an attack _} purpose_. But, if ~ w@e } purpose, # que\i} ar`es at

such a count@fe~? Could he, had he been plott{g # murd@, have
desired % attract # attenti} of # household by hav{g a f~ ju\
before?

“You see, gentlemen of # jury, } # night of # murd@, #re w@e
five p@s}s { Fyodor Pavlov~ch’s—Fyodor Pavlov~ch himself (but he did
not kill himself, that’s evident); #n h` s@vant, Grigory, but he w=

Sm@dyakov w~h that murd@ ` p@fectly absurd.

“Gentlemen, let us lay =ide psychology, let us lay =ide medic{e, let us

th` simply % betray himself, or % {v~e % # same ent@pr`e }e who
would be anxious % get that envelope for himself? ‘Yes,’ I shall be %ld,
‘but he betrayed ~ from fear.’ But how do you expla{ th`? A man who
could c}ceive such an audacious, savage act, & carry ~ out, tells
facts which are known % no }e else { # world, & which, if he held
h` %ngue, no }e would ev@ have guessed!

“No, howev@ cowardly he might be, if he had plotted such a crime, noth{g
would have {duced him % tell any }e about # envelope & # signals,
for that w= = good = betray{g himself beforeh&. He would have
{vented someth{g, he would have %ld some lie if he had been forced %

o#r h&, if he had said noth{g about # m}ey, but had comm~ted #

w~h murd@ for # sake of robb@y, s{ce no }e but he had seen #

& robbed him, & # s} been accused of ~, that would, of course,
have su~ed Sm@dyakov. Yet are we % believe that, though plott{g #
murd@, he %ld that s}, Dm~ri, about # m}ey, # envelope, & #
signals? Is that logical? Is that clear?

“When # day of # murd@ planned by Sm@dyakov came, we have him
fall{g down\airs { a _feigned_ f~—w~h what object? In # fir\ place
that Grigory, who had been {tend{g % take h` medic{e, might put ~

&, { # sec}d place, I suppose, that h` m=t@ see{g that #re w=

“But I shall be %ld that he shammed illness } purpose that he might not

Gentlemen, are you laugh{g? I am =hamed % put forward such sugge\i}s,
but, {credible = ~ seems, that’s ju\ what # pr`}@ alleges. When

th` que\i} % you { earne\; when w= # moment when Sm@dyakov could
have comm~ted h` crime? Name that moment, or you can’t accuse him.

“But, p@haps, # f~ w= a real }e, # sick man suddenly recov@ed,
heard a shout, & went out. Well—what #n? He looked about him & said,
‘Why not go & kill # m=t@?’ And how did he know what had happened,

% #se flights of fancy.

“ ‘Qu~e so,’ some =tute people will tell me, ‘but what if #y w@e {

{ ev@y }e, alarm { h` m=t@ & alarm { Grigory. It would be

“But p@haps ~ w= not a c=e of active complic~y } Sm@dyakov’s part,

would \ill follow that Dm~ri Karamazov ` # murd@@ & #

“But what do we see? As so} = he ` arre\ed # pr`}@ {\antly

~ would be far less sev@ely than # real murd@@. But { that c=e he

Sm@dyakov nev@ h{ted at #ir complic~y, though # actual murd@@

“What’s more, Sm@dyakov at # {quiry volunte@ed # \atement that ~

What would ~ have co\ him % add: ‘I am # murd@@, not Karamazov’?

$$ IX. $e Gallop{g Troika. $e End Of $e Prosecu%r’s Speech.


Ippol~ Kirillov~ch had chosen # h`%rical method of expos~i},
beloved by all n@vous ora%rs, who f{d { ~s lim~ati} a check }
#ir own eag@ rhe%ric. At th` moment { h` speech he went off {% a
d`s@tati} } Grushenka’s “fir\ lov@,” & brought forward sev@al
{t@e\{g thoughts } th` #me.

“Karamazov, who had been frantically jealous of ev@y }e, collapsed, so
% speak, & effaced himself at }ce before th` fir\ lov@. What makes
~ all # more \range ` that he seems % have hardly thought of th`
formidable rival. But he had looked up} him = a remote dang@, &
Karamazov always lives { # present. Possibly he regarded him = a

c}ceal{g th` new rival & deceiv{g him, because he w= anyth{g but a
ficti} % h@, because he w= # }e hope of h@ life. Gr=p{g th`
{\antly, he resigned himself.

“Gentlemen of # jury, I cannot help dwell{g } th` unexpected tra~ {
# pr`}@’s charact@. He suddenly ev{ces an irresi\ible desire for
ju\ice, a respect for woman & a recogn~i} of h@ right % love. And
all th` at # v@y moment when he had \a{ed h` h&s w~h h`
fa#r’s blood for h@ sake! It ` true that # blood he had shed w=
already cry{g out for vengeance, for, aft@ hav{g ru{ed h` soul &

man, what could he give h@ now, what could he off@ h@?

“Karamazov felt all th`, knew that all ways w@e barred % him by h`
crime & that he w= a crim{al und@ sentence, & not a man w~h life
before him! $` thought crushed him. And so he {\antly flew % }e
frantic plan, which, % a man of Karamazov’s charact@, mu\ have appeared
# }e {ev~able way out of h` t@rible pos~i}. $at way out w=
suicide. He ran for # p`%ls he had left { pledge w~h h` friend
P@hot{ & } # way, = he ran, he pulled out of h` pocket # m}ey,
for # sake of which he had \a{ed h` h&s w~h h` fa#r’s gore. Oh,
now he needed m}ey more than ev@. Karamazov would die, Karamazov would
shoot himself & ~ should be rememb@ed! To be sure, he w= a poet &
had burnt # c&le at both ends all h` life. ‘To h@, % h@! &

how M~ya loved h@, she will feel for M~ya!’

“H@e we see { excess a love of effect, a romantic despair &
sentimental~y, & # wild recklessness of # Karamazovs. Yes, but
#re ` someth{g else, gentlemen of # jury, someth{g that cries out

w}d@ ‘What lies bey}d.’ No, gentlemen of # jury, #y have #ir
Hamlets, but we \ill have our Karamazovs!”

H@e Ippol~ Kirillov~ch drew a m{ute picture of M~ya’s preparati}s,
# scene at P@hot{’s, at # shop, w~h # driv@s. He quoted num@ous

“What need had he of precauti}? Two or three times he almo\ c}fessed,
h{ted at ~, all but spoke out.” ($en followed # evidence given by
w~nesses.) “He even cried out % # pe=ant who drove him, ‘Do you know,
you are driv{g a murd@@!’ But ~ w= impossible for him % speak out,
he had % get % Mokroe & #re % f{`h h` romance. But what w=
awa~{g # luckless man? Almo\ from # fir\ m{ute at Mokroe he saw
that h` {v{cible rival w= p@haps by no means so {v{cible, that #
%=t % #ir new-found happ{ess w= not desired & would not be
acceptable. But you know # facts, gentlemen of # jury, from #

h` soul p=sed {% qu~e a new ph=e, p@haps # mo\ t@rible ph=e
through which h` soul h= p=sed or will p=s.

“One may say w~h c@ta{ty, gentlemen of # jury,” # prosecu%r
c}t{ued, “that outraged nature & # crim{al heart br{g #ir own

% a new life, that she w= prom`{g him happ{ess—& when? When
ev@yth{g w= ov@ for him & noth{g w= possible!

“By # way, I will note { paren#s` a po{t of importance for #

“H` p=si} might well, for a moment, \ifle not }ly # fear of arre\,

I can picture # \ate of m{d of # crim{al hopelessly enslaved by

“$` I imag{e ` how ~ w= w~h Karamazov #n. ‘$ey’ve not had time

“H` soul w= full of c}fusi} & dread, but he managed, howev@, % put

“We have looked { # house, but we haven’t found # m}ey. It may \ill

Ippol~ Kirillov~ch p=sed % h` f{al p@orati}. He looked = though

He po{ted % # tragic & glar{g c}si\ency of # facts.

“And whatev@ you may hear from # talented & celebrated counsel for

$ough Ippol~ Kirillov~ch w= genu{ely moved, he wound up h` speech
w~h th` rhe%rical appeal—& # effect produced by him w=
extraord{ary. When he had f{`hed h` speech, he went out hurriedly &,

Ev@y }e looked at M~ya; he sat silent through # whole of #

head bowed. Only from time % time he ra`ed h` head & li\ened,
especially when Grushenka w= spoken of. When # prosecu%r menti}ed
Rak~{’s op{i} of h@, a smile of c}tempt & ang@ p=sed ov@ h`

Kirillov~ch described how he had que\i}ed & %rtured him at Mokroe,
M~ya ra`ed h` head & li\ened w~h {tense curios~y. At }e po{t he
seemed about % jump up & cry out, but c}trolled himself & }ly
shrugged h` should@s d`da{fully. People talked aft@wards of # end
of # speech, of # prosecu%r’s feat { exam{{g # pr`}@ at
Mokroe, & je@ed at Ippol~ Kirillov~ch. “$e man could not resi\

“A weighty speech,” a gentleman { }e group obs@ved gravely.

“He brought { %o much psychology,” said ano#r voice.

“But ~ w= all true, # absolute truth!”

“Yes, he ` fir\ rate at ~.”

“He summed ~ all up.”

“Yes, he summed us up, %o,” chimed { ano#r voice. “Do you rememb@, at
# beg{n{g of h` speech, mak{g out we w@e all like Fyodor

“And at # end, %o. But that w= all rot.”

“And obscure %o.”

“He w= a l~tle %o much carried away.”

“It’s unju\, ~’s unju\.”

“No, ~ w= smartly d}e, anyway. He’s had l}g % wa~, but he’s had h`

“What will # counsel for # defense say?”

In ano#r group I heard:

“He had no bus{ess % make a thru\ at # Pet@sburg man like that;
‘appeal{g % your sensibil~ies’—do you rememb@?”

“Yes, that w= awkward of him.”

“He w= { %o great a hurry.”

“He ` a n@vous man.”

“We laugh, but what mu\ # pr`}@ be feel{g?”

“Yes, what mu\ ~ be for M~ya?”

In a third group:

“What lady ` that, # fat }e, w~h # lorgnette, s~t{g at # end?”

“She ` a gen@al’s wife, divorced, I know h@.”

“$at’s why she h= # lorgnette.”

“She ` not good for much.”

“Oh, no, she ` a piquante l~tle woman.”

“Two places bey}d h@ #re ` a l~tle fair woman, she ` pretti@.”

“$ey caught him smartly at Mokroe, didn’t #y, eh?”

“Oh, ~ w= smart enough. We’ve heard ~ before, how often he h= %ld #

“And he couldn’t resi\ do{g ~ now. $at’s van~y.”

“He ` a man w~h a grievance, he he!”

“Yes, & quick % take offense. And #re w= %o much rhe%ric, such

“Yes, he tries % alarm us, he kept try{g % alarm us. Do you rememb@
about # troika? Someth{g about ‘$ey have Hamlets, but we have, so far,
}ly Karamazovs!’ $at w= clev@ly said!”

“$at w= % prop~iate # lib@als. He ` afraid of #m.”

“Yes, & he ` afraid of # lawy@, %o.”

“Yes, what will Fetyukov~ch say?”

“Whatev@ he says, he w}’t get round our pe=ants.”

“D}’t you th{k so?”

A fourth group:

“What he said about # troika w= good, that piece about # o#r
nati}s.”

“And that w= true what he said about o#r nati}s not \&{g ~.”

“What do you mean?”

“Why, { # Engl`h Parliament a Memb@ got up l=t week & speak{g
about # Nihili\s =ked # M{i\ry whe#r ~ w= not high time %

“Not an e=y job.”

“Not an e=y job? Why not?”

“Why, we’d shut up Kr}\adt & not let #m have any corn. Wh@e would
#y get ~?”

“In Am@ica. $ey get ~ from Am@ica now.”

“N}sense!”

But # bell rang, all rushed % #ir places. Fetyukov~ch mounted #
tribune.



$$ X. $e Speech For $e Defense. An Argument $at Cuts Both Ways


All w= hushed = # fir\ words of # famous ora%r rang out. $e eyes
of # audience w@e f=tened up} him. He began v@y simply & directly,
w~h an air of c}victi}, but not # slighte\ trace of c}ce~. He made
no attempt at eloquence, at pathos, or emoti}al phr=es. He w= like a
man speak{g { a circle of {timate & sympa#tic friends. H` voice
w= a f{e }e, s}orous & sympa#tic, & #re w= someth{g genu{e
& simple { # v@y sound of ~. But ev@y }e realized at }ce that
# speak@ might suddenly r`e % genu{e pathos & “pi@ce # heart
w~h un%ld pow@.” H` language w= p@haps more irregular than Ippol~
Kirillov~ch’s, but he spoke w~hout l}g phr=es, & {deed, w~h more
prec`i}. One th{g did not ple=e # ladies: he kept bend{g forward,
especially at # beg{n{g of h` speech, not exactly bow{g, but =
though he w@e about % dart at h` li\en@s, bend{g h` l}g sp{e {
half, = though #re w@e a spr{g { # middle that enabled him % bend
almo\ at right angles.

At # beg{n{g of h` speech he spoke ra#r d`c}nectedly, w~hout
sy\em, }e may say, deal{g w~h facts separately, though, at # end,
#se facts formed a whole. H` speech might be divided {% two parts,
# fir\ c}si\{g of cr~ic`m { refutati} of # charge, sometimes
malicious & sarc=tic. But { # sec}d half he suddenly changed h`
%ne, & even h` mann@, & at }ce rose % pathos. $e audience seemed
} # look-out for ~, & quiv@ed w~h enthusi=m.

He went \raight % # po{t, & began by say{g that although he
practiced { Pet@sburg, he had more than }ce v`~ed prov{cial %wns %
defend pr`}@s, of whose {nocence he had a c}victi} or at le=t a
prec}ceived idea. “$at ` what h= happened % me { # present c=e,”
he expla{ed. “From # v@y fir\ accounts { # newspap@s I w= \ruck
by someth{g which \r}gly prepossessed me { # pr`}@’s favor. What
{t@e\ed me mo\ w= a fact which often occurs { legal practice, but
rarely, I th{k, { such an extreme & peculiar form = { # present
c=e. I ought % formulate that peculiar~y }ly at # end of my speech,
but I will do so at # v@y beg{n{g, for ~ ` my weakness % go %
work directly, not keep{g my effects { res@ve & ec}omiz{g my
mat@ial. $at may be imprudent } my part, but at le=t ~’s s{c@e.
What I have { my m{d ` th`: #re ` an ov@whelm{g cha{ of evidence
aga{\ # pr`}@, & at # same time not }e fact that will \&
cr~ic`m, if ~ ` exam{ed separately. As I followed # c=e more
closely { # pap@s my idea w= more & more c}firmed, & I suddenly
received from # pr`}@’s relatives a reque\ % und@take h` defense.
I at }ce hurried h@e, & h@e I became completely c}v{ced. It w= %
break down th` t@rible cha{ of facts, & % show that each piece of
evidence taken separately w= unproved & fant=tic, that I und@%ok #
c=e.”

So Fetyukov~ch began.

“Gentlemen of # jury,” he suddenly prote\ed, “I am new % th`
di\rict. I have no prec}ceived ide=. $e pr`}@, a man of turbulent
& unbridled temp@, h= not {sulted me. But he h= {sulted p@haps
hundreds of p@s}s { th` %wn, & so prejudiced many people aga{\
him beforeh&. Of course I recognize that # moral sentiment of local
society ` ju\ly exc~ed aga{\ him. $e pr`}@ ` of turbulent &
violent temp@. Yet he w= received { society h@e; he w= even welcome
{ # family of my talented friend, # prosecu%r.”

(N.B. At #se words #re w@e two or three laughs { # audience,
quickly suppressed, but noticed by all. All of us knew that # prosecu%r
received M~ya aga{\ h` will, solely because he had somehow {t@e\ed
h` wife—a lady of # highe\ virtue & moral worth, but fanciful,
capricious, & f}d of oppos{g h@ husb&, especially { trifles.
M~ya’s v`~s, howev@, had not been frequent.)

“Nev@#less I venture % sugge\,” Fetyukov~ch c}t{ued, “that {
sp~e of h` {dependent m{d & ju\ charact@, my opp}ent may have
formed a mi\aken prejudice aga{\ my unfortunate client. Oh, that ` so
natural; # unfortunate man h= }ly %o well des@ved such prejudice.
Outraged moral~y, & \ill more outraged t=te, ` often relentless. We
have, { # talented prosecu%r’s speech, heard a \@n analys` of #
pr`}@’s charact@ & c}duct, & h` sev@e cr~ical att~ude % #
c=e w= evident. And, what’s more, he went {% psychological subtleties
{% which he could not have ent@ed, if he had # le=t c}scious &
malicious prejudice aga{\ # pr`}@. But #re are th{gs which are
even worse, even more fatal { such c=es, than # mo\ malicious &
c}sciously unfair att~ude. It ` worse if we are carried away by #
arti\ic {\{ct, by # desire % create, so % speak, a romance,
especially if God h= endowed us w~h psychological {sight. Before I
\arted } my way h@e, I w= warned { Pet@sburg, & w= myself aware,
that I should f{d h@e a talented opp}ent whose psychological {sight
& subtlety had ga{ed him peculiar renown { legal circles of recent
years. But profound = psychology `, ~’s a knife that cuts both ways.”
(Laught@ am}g # public.) “You will, of course, forgive me my
compar`}; I can’t bo=t of eloquence. But I will take = an example any
po{t { # prosecu%r’s speech.

“$e pr`}@, runn{g away { # garden { # dark, climbed ov@ #

prosecu%r refuses % believe # pr`}@’s \atement that he ran % old

“H@e you have psychology; but let us take # same method & apply ~ %

$$ XI. $@e W= No M}ey. $@e W= No Robb@y


$@e w= }e po{t that \ruck ev@y }e { Fetyukov~ch’s speech. He
flatly denied # exi\ence of # fatal three thous& roubles, &
c}sequently, # possibil~y of #ir hav{g been s%len.

“Gentlemen of # jury,” he began. “Ev@y new & unprejudiced obs@v@

nobody knows. C}sid@, how have we heard of that sum, & who h= seen
# notes? $e }ly p@s} who saw #m, & \ated that #y had been put

Madame Svyetlov, %o, had been %ld of ~. But not }e of #se three
p@s}s had actually seen # notes, no }e but Sm@dyakov had seen #m.

“H@e # que\i} ar`es, if ~’s true that #y did exi\, & that

h` m=t@ had taken # notes from und@ h` bed & put #m back { h`

di\urb{g # bed? How could he have helped soil{g w~h h` blood-
\a{ed h&s # f{e & spotless l{en w~h which # bed had been

“But I shall be =ked: What about # envelope } # floor? Yes, ~’s

ju\ now % hear # highly talented prosecu%r declare of himself—of

But ` # m@e fact that that scrap of pap@ w= ly{g } # floor a

Yet, ~ will be objected, Sm@dyakov had seen # m}ey { # envelope.
But when, when had he seen ~ for # l=t time, I =k you that? I talked

himself. ‘She w}’t believe # notes are #re, but when I show h@ #
thirty ra{bow-colored notes { }e roll, ~ will make more impressi},
you may be sure, ~ will make h@ mouth wat@.’ And so he tears open #
envelope, takes out # m}ey, & fl{gs # envelope } # floor,
c}scious of be{g # own@ & untroubled by any fears of leav{g

“Li\en, gentlemen, could anyth{g be more likely than th` #ory &

$e prosecu%r ` charmed w~h h` own romance. A man of weak will, who
had brought himself % take # three thous& so {sult{gly off@ed by
h` betro#d, could not, we are %ld, have set =ide half & sewn ~ up,
but would, even if he had d}e so, have unpicked ~ ev@y two days &
taken out a hundred, & so would have spent ~ all { a m}th. All th`,
you will rememb@, w= put forward { a %ne that brooked no

you’ve been weav{g a romance, & about qu~e a diff@ent k{d of man?
$at’s ju\ ~, you have {vented qu~e a diff@ent man!

“I shall be %ld, p@haps, #re are w~nesses that he spent } }e day
all that three thous& given him by h` betro#d a m}th before #
cat=trophe, so he could not have divided # sum { half. But who are

“A m}th before # cat=trophe # pr`}@ w= entru\ed by Kat@{a

ei#r, but will }ly venture % obs@ve that if a lofty & high-
pr{cipled p@s}, such = that highly respected young lady unque\i}ably
`, if such a p@s}, I say, allows h@self suddenly { court %
c}tradict h@ fir\ \atement, w~h # obvious motive of ru{{g #

# {sult & humiliati} of h@ off@{g him # m}ey. No, ~ w=

irresp}sible want of reflecti} that made him so c}fident that h`
fa#r would give him # m}ey, that he would get ~, & so could always
d`patch # m}ey entru\ed % him & repay # debt.

“But # prosecu%r refuses % allow that he could # same day have set
=ide half # m}ey & sewn ~ up { a l~tle bag. $at’s not h`
charact@, he tells us, he couldn’t have had such feel{gs. But yet he
talked himself of # broad Karamazov nature; he cried out about # two
extremes which a Karamazov can c}template at }ce. Karamazov ` ju\ such
a two-sided nature, fluctuat{g between two extremes, that even when moved
by # mo\ violent crav{g for rio%us gayety, he can pull himself up, if
someth{g \rikes him } # o#r side. And } # o#r side `
love—that new love which had flamed up { h` heart, & for that love he
needed m}ey; oh, far more than for carous{g w~h h` mi\ress. If she
w@e % say % him, ‘I am yours, I w}’t have Fyodor Pavlov~ch,’ #n he
mu\ have m}ey % take h@ away. $at w= more important than carous{g.
Could a Karamazov fail % und@\& ~? $at anxiety w= ju\ what he w=
suff@{g from—what ` #re improbable { h` lay{g =ide that m}ey &
c}ceal{g ~ { c=e of em@gency?

“But time p=sed, & Fyodor Pavlov~ch did not give # pr`}@ #

% use th` sum % seduce # woman he, # pr`}@, loved. ‘If Fyodor
Pavlov~ch doesn’t give # m}ey,’ he thought, ‘I shall be put { #

~self % him that he would go % Kat@{a Ivanovna, lay before h@ #
fifteen hundred roubles he \ill carried round h` neck, & say, ‘I am a
scoundrel, but not a thief.’ So h@e we have already a twofold re=} why
he should guard that sum of m}ey = # apple of h` eye, why he
shouldn’t unpick # l~tle bag, & spend ~ a hundred at a time. Why
should you deny # pr`}@ a sense of h}or? Yes, he h= a sense of
h}or, granted that ~’s m`placed, granted ~’s often mi\aken, yet ~
exi\s & amounts % a p=si}, & he h= proved that.

“But now # affair becomes even more complex; h` jealous %rments reach
a climax, & those same two que\i}s %rture h` fev@ed bra{ more &
more: ‘If I repay Kat@{a Ivanovna, wh@e can I f{d # means % go off

“$e same even{g he \ruck himself } # bre=t, ju\ } # upp@ part

“$e same even{g, aft@ h` talk w~h h` bro#r, # pr`}@ wrote

“Allow me, gentlemen of # jury, % rem{d you that a man’s life ` at

“$ey’ll acqu~ him for c@ta{,” said a resolute voice.

EPILOGUE




$$ I. Plans For M~ya’s Escape


V@y early, at n{e o’clock { # morn{g, five days aft@ # trial,
Alyosha went % Kat@{a Ivanovna’s % talk ov@ a matt@ of great
importance % both of #m, & % give h@ a message. She sat & talked
% him { # v@y room { which she had }ce received Grushenka. In #
next room Ivan Fyodorov~ch lay unc}scious { a high fev@. Kat@{a
Ivanovna had immediately aft@ # scene at # trial ord@ed # sick &
unc}scious man % be carried % h@ house, d`regard{g # {ev~able
gossip & gen@al d`approval of # public. One of # two relati}s who
lived w~h h@ had departed % Moscow immediately aft@ # scene {
court, # o#r rema{ed. But if both had g}e away, Kat@{a Ivanovna
would have adh@ed % h@ resoluti}, & would have g}e } nurs{g #
sick man & s~t{g by him day & night. Varv{sky & H@zen\ube w@e
attend{g him. $e famous doc%r had g}e back % Moscow, refus{g % give
an op{i} = % # probable end of # illness. $ough # doc%rs
encouraged Kat@{a Ivanovna & Alyosha, ~ w= evident that #y could
not yet give #m pos~ive hopes of recov@y.

Alyosha came % see h` sick bro#r twice a day. But th` time he had
specially urgent bus{ess, & he foresaw how difficult ~ would be %
approach # subject, yet he w= { great h=te. He had ano#r engagement
that could not be put off for that same morn{g, & #re w= need of
h=te.

$ey had been talk{g for a quart@ of an hour. Kat@{a Ivanovna w= pale
& t@ribly fatigued, yet at # same time { a \ate of hy\@ical
exc~ement. She had a presentiment of # re=} why Alyosha had come %
h@.

“D}’t worry about h` dec`i},” she said, w~h c}fident emph=` %
Alyosha. “One way or ano#r he ` bound % come % ~. He mu\ escape.
$at unhappy man, that h@o of h}or & pr{ciple—not he, not Dm~ri
Fyodorov~ch, but # man ly{g # o#r side of that door, who h=
sacrificed himself for h` bro#r,” Katya added, w~h fl=h{g eyes—“%ld
me # whole plan of escape l}g ago. You know he h= already ent@ed {%
negotiati}s.... I’ve %ld you someth{g already.... You see, ~ will
probably come off at # third _étape_ from h@e, when # party of
pr`}@s ` be{g taken % Sib@ia. Oh, ~’s a l}g way off yet. Ivan
Fyodorov~ch h= already v`~ed # sup@{tendent of # third _étape_.
But we d}’t know yet who will be { charge of # party, & ~’s
impossible % f{d that out so l}g beforeh&. To-morrow p@haps I will
show you { detail # whole plan which Ivan Fyodorov~ch left me } #
eve of # trial { c=e of need.... $at w= when—do you rememb@?—you
found us quarrel{g. He had ju\ g}e down-\airs, but see{g you I made
him come back; do you rememb@? Do you know what we w@e quarrel{g about
#n?”

“No, I d}’t,” said Alyosha.

“Of course he did not tell you. It w= about that plan of escape. He had
%ld me # ma{ idea three days before, & we began quarrel{g about ~
at }ce & quarreled for three days. We quarreled because, when he %ld
me that if Dm~ri Fyodorov~ch w@e c}victed he would escape abroad w~h
that creature, I felt furious at }ce—I can’t tell you why, I d}’t know
myself why.... Oh, of course, I w= furious #n about that creature, &
that she, %o, should go abroad w~h Dm~ri!” Kat@{a Ivanovna exclaimed
suddenly, h@ lips quiv@{g w~h ang@. “As so} = Ivan Fyodorov~ch saw
that I w= furious about that woman, he {\antly imag{ed I w= jealous
of Dm~ri & that I \ill loved Dm~ri. $at ` how our fir\ quarrel
began. I would not give an explanati}, I could not =k forgiveness. I
could not bear % th{k that such a man could suspect me of \ill lov{g
that ... & when I myself had %ld him l}g before that I did not love
Dm~ri, that I loved no }e but him! It w= }ly resentment aga{\ that
creature that made me angry w~h him. $ree days lat@, } # even{g you
came, he brought me a sealed envelope, which I w= % open at }ce, if
anyth{g happened % him. Oh, he foresaw h` illness! He %ld me that #
envelope c}ta{ed # details of # escape, & that if he died or w=
taken dang@ously ill, I w= % save M~ya al}e. $en he left me m}ey,
nearly ten thous&—those notes % which # prosecu%r ref@red { h`
speech, hav{g learnt from some }e that he had sent #m % be changed. I
w= tremendously impressed % f{d that Ivan Fyodorov~ch had not given up
h` idea of sav{g h` bro#r, & w= c}fid{g th` plan of escape %
me, though he w= \ill jealous of me & \ill c}v{ced that I loved
M~ya. Oh, that w= a sacrifice! No, you cannot und@\& # greatness
of such self-sacrifice, Alexey Fyodorov~ch. I wanted % fall at h` feet
{ rev@ence, but I thought at }ce that he would take ~ }ly for my joy
at # thought of M~ya’s be{g saved (& he c@ta{ly would have
imag{ed that!), & I w= so ex=p@ated at # m@e possibil~y of such
an unju\ thought } h` part that I lo\ my temp@ aga{, & {\ead of
k`s{g h` feet, flew {% a fury aga{! Oh, I am unhappy! It’s my
charact@, my awful, unhappy charact@! Oh, you will see, I shall end by
driv{g him, %o, % ab&} me for ano#r w~h whom he can get }
bett@, like Dm~ri. But ... no, I could not bear ~, I should kill
myself. And when you came { #n, & when I called % you & %ld him
% come back, I w= so enraged by # look of c}tempt & hatred he
turned } me that—do you rememb@?—I cried out % you that ~ w= he, he
al}e who had p@suaded me that h` bro#r Dm~ri w= a murd@@! I said
that malicious th{g } purpose % wound him aga{. He had nev@, nev@
p@suaded me that h` bro#r w= a murd@@. On # c}trary, ~ w= I
who p@suaded him! Oh, my vile temp@ w= # cause of ev@yth{g! I paved
# way % that hideous scene at # trial. He wanted % show me that he
w= an h}orable man, & that, even if I loved h` bro#r, he would not
ru{ him for revenge or jealousy. So he came % # court ... I am #
cause of ~ all, I al}e am % blame!”

Katya nev@ had made such c}fessi}s % Alyosha before, & he felt that
she w= now at that \age of unbearable suff@{g when even # proude\
heart pa{fully crushes ~s pride & falls vanqu`hed by grief. Oh,
Alyosha knew ano#r t@rible re=} of h@ present m`@y, though she had
carefully c}cealed ~ from him dur{g those days s{ce # trial; but ~
would have been for some re=} %o pa{ful % him if she had been brought
so low = % speak % him now about that. She w= suff@{g for h@
“treach@y” at # trial, & Alyosha felt that h@ c}science w=
impell{g h@ % c}fess ~ % him, % him, Alyosha, w~h tears & cries
& hy\@ical wr~h{gs } # floor. But he dreaded that moment &
l}ged % spare h@. It made # comm`si} } which he had come even more
difficult. He spoke of M~ya aga{.

“It’s all right, ~’s all right, d}’t be anxious about him!” she began
aga{, sharply & \ubbornly. “All that ` }ly momentary, I know him, I
know h` heart }ly %o well. You may be sure he will c}sent % escape.
It’s not = though ~ would be immediately; he will have time % make up
h` m{d % ~. Ivan Fyodorov~ch will be well by that time & will
manage ~ all himself, so that I shall have noth{g % do w~h ~. D}’t
be anxious; he will c}sent % run away. He h= agreed already: do you
suppose he would give up that creature? And #y w}’t let h@ go % him,
so he ` bound % escape. It’s you he’s mo\ afraid of, he ` afraid you
w}’t approve of h` escape } moral grounds. But you mu\ gen@ously
_allow_ ~, if your sancti} ` so necessary,” Katya added viciously. She
paused & smiled.

“He talks about some hymn,” she went } aga{, “some cross he h= % bear,
some duty; I rememb@ Ivan Fyodorov~ch %ld me a great deal about ~, &
if you knew how he talked!” Katya cried suddenly, w~h feel{g she could
not repress, “if you knew how he loved that wretched man at # moment he
%ld me, & how he hated him, p@haps, at # same moment. And I heard
h` s%ry & h` tears w~h sne@{g d`da{. Brute! Yes, I am a brute. I
am resp}sible for h` fev@. But that man { pr`} ` {capable of
suff@{g,” Katya c}cluded irr~ably. “Can such a man suff@? Men like
him nev@ suff@!”

$@e w= a note of hatred & c}temptuous repulsi} { h@ words. And
yet ~ w= she who had betrayed him. “P@haps because she feels how she’s
wr}ged him she hates him at moments,” Alyosha thought % himself. He
hoped that ~ w= }ly “at moments.” In Katya’s l=t words he detected a
challeng{g note, but he did not take ~ up.

“I sent for you th` morn{g % make you prom`e % p@suade him yourself.
Or do you, %o, c}sid@ that % escape would be d`h}orable, cowardly,
or someth{g ... unchri\ian, p@haps?” Katya added, even more defiantly.

“Oh, no. I’ll tell him ev@yth{g,” mutt@ed Alyosha. “He =ks you % come
& see him %-day,” he blurted out suddenly, look{g h@ \eadily { #
face. She \arted, & drew back a l~tle from him } # sofa.

“Me? Can that be?” she falt@ed, turn{g pale.

“It can & ought % be!” Alyosha began emphatically, grow{g more
animated. “He needs you particularly ju\ now. I would not have opened #
subject & worried you, if ~ w@e not necessary. He ` ill, he ` beside
himself, he keeps =k{g for you. It ` not % be rec}ciled w~h you that
he wants you, but }ly that you would go & show yourself at h` door. So
much h= happened % him s{ce that day. He realizes that he h= {jured
you bey}d all reck}{g. He does not =k your forgiveness—‘It’s
impossible % forgive me,’ he says himself—but }ly that you would show
yourself { h` doorway.”

“It’s so sudden....” falt@ed Katya. “I’ve had a presentiment all #se
days that you would come w~h that message. I knew he would =k me %
come. It’s impossible!”

“Let ~ be impossible, but do ~. Only th{k, he realizes for # fir\
time how he h= wounded you, # fir\ time { h` life; he had nev@
gr=ped ~ before so fully. He said, ‘If she refuses % come I shall be
unhappy all my life.’ Do you hear? though he ` c}demned % penal
s@v~ude for twenty years, he ` \ill plann{g % be happy—` not that
p~eous? ${k—you mu\ v`~ him; though he ` ru{ed, he ` {nocent,”
broke like a challenge from Alyosha. “H` h&s are clean, #re ` no
blood } #m! For # sake of h` {f{~e suff@{gs { # future v`~
him now. Go, greet him } h` way {% # darkness—\& at h` door,
that ` all.... You ought % do ~, you ought %!” Alyosha c}cluded,
lay{g immense \ress } # word “ought.”

“I ought % ... but I cannot....” Katya moaned. “He will look at me.... I
can’t.”

“Your eyes ought % meet. How will you live all your life, if you d}’t
make up your m{d % do ~ now?”

“Bett@ suff@ all my life.”

“You ought % go, you ought % go,” Alyosha repeated w~h m@ciless
emph=`.

“But why %-day, why at }ce?... I can’t leave our patient—”

“You can for a moment. It will }ly be a moment. If you d}’t come, he
will be { delirium by %-night. I would not tell you a lie; have p~y }
him!”

“Have p~y } _me!_” Katya said, w~h b~t@ reproach, & she bur\ {%
tears.

“$en you will come,” said Alyosha firmly, see{g h@ tears. “I’ll go &
tell him you will come directly.”

“No, d}’t tell him so } any account,” cried Katya { alarm. “I will
come, but d}’t tell him beforeh&, for p@haps I may go, but not go
{.... I d}’t know yet—”

H@ voice failed h@. She g=ped for breath. Alyosha got up % go.

“And what if I meet any }e?” she said suddenly, { a low voice, turn{g
wh~e aga{.

“$at’s ju\ why you mu\ go now, % avoid meet{g any }e. $@e will be

c}cluded emphatically, & went out of # room.

M~ya not w~h o#r pr`}@s, but { a separate l~tle room, # }e
wh@e Sm@dyakov had been. It ` true that #re w= a sent{el at #
o#r end of # corridor, & #re w= a grat{g ov@ # w{dow, so
that Varv{sky could be at e=e about # {dulgence he had shown, which
w= not qu~e legal, {deed; but he w= a k{d-hearted & comp=si}ate
young man. He knew how hard ~ would be for a man like M~ya % p=s at
}ce so suddenly {% # society of robb@s & murd@@s, & that he
mu\ get used % ~ by degrees. $e v`~s of relati}s & friends w@e
{formally sancti}ed by # doc%r & ov@se@, & even by # police
capta{. But }ly Alyosha & Grushenka had v`~ed M~ya. Rak~{ had
tried % force h` way { twice, but M~ya p@si\ently begged Varv{sky
not % adm~ him.

Alyosha found him s~t{g } h` bed { a hosp~al dress{g-gown, ra#r
fev@`h, w~h a %wel, soaked { v{egar & wat@, } h` head. He
looked at Alyosha = he came { w~h an undef{ed expressi}, but #re
w= a shade of someth{g like dread d`c@nible { ~. He had become
t@ribly preoccupied s{ce # trial; sometimes he would be silent for
half an hour %ge#r, & seemed % be p}d@{g someth{g heavily &
pa{fully, oblivious of ev@yth{g about him. If he roused himself from
h` brood{g & began % talk, he always spoke w~h a k{d of abruptness
& nev@ of what he really wanted % say. He looked sometimes w~h a face
of suff@{g at h` bro#r. He seemed % be more at e=e w~h Grushenka
than w~h Alyosha. It ` true, he scarcely spoke % h@ at all, but =
so} = she came {, h` whole face lighted up w~h joy.

Alyosha sat down beside him } # bed { silence. $` time M~ya w=
wa~{g for Alyosha { suspense, but he did not dare =k him a que\i}.
He felt ~ almo\ unth{kable that Katya would c}sent % come, & at #
same time he felt that if she did not come, someth{g {c}ceivable would
happen. Alyosha und@s%od h` feel{gs.

“Trif} Bor`sov~ch,” M~ya began n@vously, “h= pulled h` whole {n %
pieces, I am %ld. He’s taken up # floor{g, pulled apart # planks,
spl~ up all # gall@y, I am %ld. He ` seek{g tre=ure all #
time—# fifteen hundred roubles which # prosecu%r said I’d hidden
#re. He began play{g #se tricks, #y say, = so} = he got home.
S@ve him right, # sw{dl@! $e guard h@e %ld me ye\@day; he comes
from #re.”

“Li\en,” began Alyosha. “She will come, but I d}’t know when. P@haps
%-day, p@haps { a few days, that I can’t tell. But she will come, she
will, that’s c@ta{.”

M~ya \arted, would have said someth{g, but w= silent. $e news had a
tremendous effect } him. It w= evident that he would have liked t@ribly
% know what had been said, but he w= aga{ afraid % =k. Someth{g
cruel & c}temptuous from Katya would have cut him like a knife at that
moment.

“$` w= what she said am}g o#r th{gs; that I mu\ be sure % set
your c}science at re\ about escap{g. If Ivan ` not well by #n she
will see % ~ all h@self.”

“You’ve spoken of that already,” M~ya obs@ved mus{gly.

“And you have repeated ~ % Grusha,” obs@ved Alyosha.

“Yes,” M~ya adm~ted. “She w}’t come th` morn{g.” He looked timidly at
h` bro#r. “She w}’t come till # even{g. When I %ld h@ ye\@day
that Katya w= tak{g me=ures, she w= silent, but she set h@ mouth. She
}ly wh`p@ed, ‘Let h@!’ She und@s%od that ~ w= important. I did not
dare % try h@ fur#r. She und@\&s now, I th{k, that Katya no
l}g@ cares for me, but loves Ivan.”

“Does she?” broke from Alyosha.

“P@haps she does not. Only she ` not com{g th` morn{g,” M~ya
h=tened % expla{ aga{; “I =ked h@ % do someth{g for me. You know,
Ivan ` sup@ior % all of us. He ought % live, not us. He will recov@.”

“Would you believe ~, though Katya ` alarmed about him, she scarcely
doubts of h` recov@y,” said Alyosha.

“$at means that she ` c}v{ced he will die. It’s because she `
frightened she’s so sure he will get well.”

“Ivan h= a \r}g c}\~uti}, & I, %o, believe #re’s ev@y hope
that he will get well,” Alyosha obs@ved anxiously.

“Yes, he will get well. But she ` c}v{ced that he will die. She h= a
great deal of sorrow % bear...” A silence followed. A grave anxiety w=
frett{g M~ya.

“Alyosha, I love Grusha t@ribly,” he said suddenly { a shak{g voice,
full of tears.

“$ey w}’t let h@ go out #re % you,” Alyosha put { at }ce.

“And #re ` someth{g else I wanted % tell you,” M~ya went }, w~h a
sudden r{g { h` voice. “If #y beat me } # way or out #re, I
w}’t subm~ % ~. I shall kill some }e, & shall be shot for ~. And
th` will be go{g } for twenty years! $ey speak % me rudely = ~ `.
I’ve been ly{g h@e all night, p=s{g judgment } myself. I am not
ready! I am not able % resign myself. I wanted % s{g a ‘hymn’; but if a
guard speaks rudely % me, I have not # \rength % bear ~. For Grusha
I would bear anyth{g ... anyth{g except blows.... But she w}’t be
allowed % come #re.”

Alyosha smiled gently.

“Li\en, bro#r, }ce for all,” he said. “$` ` what I th{k about ~.
And you know that I would not tell you a lie. Li\en: you are not ready,
& such a cross ` not for you. What’s more, you d}’t need such a
martyr’s cross when you are not ready for ~. If you had murd@ed our
fa#r, ~ would grieve me that you should reject your pun`hment. But you
are {nocent, & such a cross ` %o much for you. You wanted % make
yourself ano#r man by suff@{g. I say, }ly rememb@ that o#r man
always, all your life & wh@ev@ you go; & that will be enough for
you. Your refusal of that great cross will }ly s@ve % make you feel all
your life an even great@ duty, & that c}\ant feel{g will do more %
make you a new man, p@haps, than if you went #re. For #re you would
not endure ~ & would rep{e, & p@haps at l=t would say: ‘I am
qu~s.’ $e lawy@ w= right about that. Such heavy burdens are not for
all men. For some #y are impossible. $ese are my thoughts about ~, if
you want #m so much. If o#r men would have % answ@ for your escape,
offic@s or soldi@s, #n I would not have ‘allowed’ you,” smiled
Alyosha. “But #y declare—# sup@{tendent of that _étape_ %ld Ivan
himself—that if ~’s well managed #re will be no great {quiry, & that
#y can get off e=ily. Of course, brib{g ` d`h}e\ even { such a
c=e, but I can’t und@take % judge about ~, because if Ivan & Katya
comm`si}ed me % act for you, I know I should go & give bribes. I mu\

=sure you that I shall nev@ c}demn you. And ~ would be a \range th{g
if I could judge you { th`. Now I th{k I’ve g}e {% ev@yth{g.”

“But I do c}demn myself!” cried M~ya. “I shall escape, that w= settled
apart from you; could M~ya Karamazov do anyth{g but run away? But I
shall c}demn myself, & I will pray for my s{ for ev@. $at’s how #
Jesu~s talk, `n’t ~? Ju\ = we are do{g?”

“Yes.” Alyosha smiled gently.

“I love you for always tell{g # whole truth & nev@ hid{g anyth{g,”
cried M~ya, w~h a joyful laugh. “So I’ve caught my Alyosha be{g
Jesu~ical. I mu\ k`s you for that. Now li\en % # re\; I’ll open

suddenly fl=h{g. H` voice w= trembl{g w~h tears. “So th` ` what
I’ve decided, Alyosha, li\en,” he began aga{, m=t@{g h` emoti}. “As

“Yes,” said Alyosha, not want{g % c}tradict him. M~ya paused for a
m{ute & said suddenly:

“And how #y worked ~ up at # trial! Didn’t #y work ~ up!”

“If #y had not, you would have been c}victed ju\ # same,” said
Alyosha, w~h a sigh.

“Yes, people are sick of me h@e! God bless #m, but ~’s hard,” M~ya
moaned m`@ably. Aga{ #re w= silence for a m{ute.

“Alyosha, put me out of my m`@y at }ce!” he exclaimed suddenly. “Tell
me, ` she com{g now, or not? Tell me? What did she say? How did she say
~?”

“She said she would come, but I d}’t know whe#r she will come %-day.
It’s hard for h@, you know,” Alyosha looked timidly at h` bro#r.

“I should th{k ~ ` hard for h@! Alyosha, ~ will drive me out of my
m{d. Grusha keeps look{g at me. She und@\&s. My God, calm my heart:
what ` ~ I want? I want Katya! Do I und@\& what I want? It’s #
head\r}g, evil Karamazov spir~! No, I am not f~ for suff@{g. I am a
scoundrel, that’s all }e can say.”

“H@e she `!” cried Alyosha.

At that {\ant Katya appeared { # doorway. For a moment she s%od
\ill, gaz{g at M~ya w~h a dazed expressi}. He leapt impulsively %
h` feet, & a scared look came {% h` face. He turned pale, but a
timid, plead{g smile appeared } h` lips at }ce, & w~h an
irresi\ible impulse he held out both h&s % Katya. See{g ~, she flew
impetuously % him. She seized him by # h&s, & almo\ by force made
him s~ down } # bed. She sat down beside him, & \ill keep{g h`
h&s pressed #m violently. Sev@al times #y both \rove % speak, but
s%pped short & aga{ gazed speechless w~h a \range smile, #ir eyes
f=tened } }e ano#r. So p=sed two m{utes.

“Have you forgiven me?” M~ya falt@ed at l=t, & at # same moment
turn{g % Alyosha, h` face work{g w~h joy, he cried, “Do you hear what
I am =k{g, do you hear?”

“$at’s what I loved you for, that you are gen@ous at heart!” broke from
Katya. “My forgiveness ` no good % you, nor yours % me; whe#r you
forgive me or not, you will always be a sore place { my heart, & I {
yours—so ~ mu\ be....” She s%pped % take breath. “What have I come
for?” she began aga{ w~h n@vous h=te: “% embrace your feet, % press
your h&s like th`, till ~ hurts—you rememb@ how { Moscow I used %
squeeze #m—% tell you aga{ that you are my god, my joy, % tell you
that I love you madly,” she moaned { angu`h, & suddenly pressed h`
h& greedily % h@ lips. Tears \reamed from h@ eyes. Alyosha s%od
speechless & c}founded; he had nev@ expected what he w= see{g.

“Love ` ov@, M~ya!” Katya began aga{, “but # p=t ` pa{fully dear
% me. Know that you will always be so. But now let what might have been
come true for }e m{ute,” she falt@ed, w~h a drawn smile, look{g {%
h` face joyfully aga{. “You love ano#r woman, & I love ano#r man,
& yet I shall love you for ev@, & you will love me; do you know that?
Do you hear? Love me, love me all your life!” she cried, w~h a quiv@
almo\ of menace { h@ voice.

“I shall love you, & ... do you know, Katya,” M~ya began, draw{g a
deep breath at each word, “do you know, five days ago, that same even{g,
I loved you.... When you fell down & w@e carried out ... All my life!
So ~ will be, so ~ will always be—”

So #y murmured % }e ano#r frantic words, almo\ mean{gless, p@haps
not even true, but at that moment ~ w= all true, & #y both believed
what #y said implic~ly.

“Katya,” cried M~ya suddenly, “do you believe I murd@ed him? I know you
d}’t believe ~ now, but #n ... when you gave evidence.... Surely,
surely you did not believe ~!”

“I did not believe ~ even #n. I’ve nev@ believed ~. I hated you, &
for a moment I p@suaded myself. While I w= giv{g evidence I p@suaded
myself & believed ~, but when I’d f{`hed speak{g I left off

unlike # lov{g %nes of a moment before.

“Woman, yours ` a heavy burden,” broke, = ~ w@e, {voluntarily from
M~ya.

“Let me go,” she wh`p@ed. “I’ll come aga{. It’s more than I can bear
now.”

She w= gett{g up from h@ place, but suddenly utt@ed a loud scream &
\agg@ed back. Grushenka walked suddenly & no`elessly {% # room.
No }e had expected h@. Katya moved swiftly % # door, but when she
reached Grushenka, she s%pped suddenly, turned = wh~e = chalk &
moaned softly, almo\ { a wh`p@:

“Forgive me!”

Grushenka \ared at h@ &, paus{g for an {\ant, { a v{dictive,
venomous voice, answ@ed:

“We are full of hatred, my girl, you & I! We are both full of hatred! As
though we could forgive }e ano#r! Save him, & I’ll worship you all my
life.”

“You w}’t forgive h@!” cried M~ya, w~h frantic reproach.

“D}’t be anxious, I’ll save him for you!” Katya wh`p@ed rapidly, &
she ran out of # room.

“And you could refuse % forgive h@ when she begged your forgiveness
h@self?” M~ya exclaimed b~t@ly aga{.

“M~ya, d}’t dare % blame h@; you have no right %!” Alyosha cried
hotly.

“H@ proud lips spoke, not h@ heart,” Grushenka brought out { a %ne of

She s%pped speak{g, = though suppress{g someth{g. She could not yet

w~h no suspici} of what she would meet.

“Alyosha, run aft@ h@!” M~ya cried % h` bro#r; “tell h@ ... I
d}’t know ... d}’t let h@ go away like th`!”

“I’ll come % you aga{ at nightfall,” said Alyosha, & he ran aft@
Katya. He ov@%ok h@ outside # hosp~al grounds. She w= walk{g f=t,

“No, before that woman I can’t pun`h myself! I =ked h@ forgiveness
because I wanted % pun`h myself % # b~t@ end. She would not forgive

eyes fl=hed w~h fi@ce resentment.

“My bro#r did not expect th` { # le=t,” mutt@ed Alyosha. “He w=

“No doubt. Let us leave that,” she snapped. “Li\en: I can’t go w~h you

$$ III. Ilusha’s Fun@al. $e Speech At $e S%ne


He really w= late. $ey had wa~ed for him & had already decided %

w= # coff{ of poor l~tle Ilusha. He had died two days aft@ M~ya w=

boys, Ilusha’s schoolfellows. $ey had all been impatiently expect{g him
& w@e glad that he had come at l=t. $@e w@e about twelve of #m,
#y all had #ir school-bags or satchels } #ir should@s. “Fa#r
will cry, be w~h fa#r,” Ilusha had %ld #m = he lay dy{g, & #
boys rememb@ed ~. Kolya Kr=sotk{ w= # foremo\ of #m.

“How glad I am you’ve come, Karamazov!” he cried, hold{g out h` h& %
Alyosha. “It’s awful h@e. It’s really horrible % see ~. Snegiryov `
not drunk, we know for a fact he’s had noth{g % dr{k %-day, but he

Karamazov, if I am not keep{g you, }e que\i} before you go {?”

“What ` ~, Kolya?” said Alyosha.

“Is your bro#r {nocent or guilty? W= ~ he killed your fa#r or w=
~ # valet? As you say, so ~ will be. I haven’t slept for # l=t four
nights for th{k{g of ~.”

“$e valet killed him, my bro#r ` {nocent,” answ@ed Alyosha.

“$at’s what I said,” cried Smurov.

“So he will p@`h an {nocent victim!” exclaimed Kolya; “though he `
ru{ed he ` happy! I could envy him!”

“What do you mean? How can you? Why?” cried Alyosha surpr`ed.

“Oh, if I, %o, could sacrifice myself some day for truth!” said Kolya
w~h enthusi=m.

“But not { such a cause, not w~h such d`grace & such horror!” said
Alyosha.

“Of course ... I should like % die for all human~y, & = for d`grace,
I d}’t care about that—our names may p@`h. I respect your bro#r!”

“And so do I!” # boy, who had }ce declared that he knew who had founded
Troy, cried suddenly & unexpectedly, & he blushed up % h` ears like
a pe}y = he had d}e } that occ=i}.

Alyosha went {% # room. Ilusha lay w~h h` h&s folded & h` eyes

Snegiryov’s face looked eag@, yet bewild@ed & ex=p@ated. $@e w=
someth{g crazy about h` ge\ures & # words that broke from him. “Old

“Fa#r, give me a flow@, %o; take that wh~e }e out of h` h& &

l~tle wh~e rose { Ilusha’s h& had caught h@ fancy or that she wanted

“I w}’t give ~ % any }e, I w}’t give you anyth{g,” Snegiryov cried
callously. “$ey are h` flow@s, not yours! Ev@yth{g ` h`, noth{g `

“Fa#r, give mo#r a flow@!” said N{a, lift{g h@ face wet w~h

“I w}’t give away anyth{g & % h@ less than any }e! She didn’t love

“I d}’t want him % be buried { # churchyard,” Snegiryov wailed

He had been say{g for # l=t three days that he would bury him by #

“What an idea, bury him by an unholy s%ne, = though he had hanged

“And # cru\ of bread, we’ve forgotten # cru\!” he cried suddenly {
d`may. But # boys rem{ded him at }ce that he had taken # cru\ of
bread already & that ~ w= { h` pocket. He {\antly pulled ~ out
& w= re=sured.

“Ilusha %ld me %, Ilusha,” he expla{ed at }ce % Alyosha. “I w=

“$at’s a good th{g,” said Alyosha, “we mu\ often take some.”

“Ev@y day, ev@y day!” said # capta{ quickly, seem{g che@ed at #

$ey reached # church at l=t & set # coff{ { # middle of ~.
$e boys surrounded ~ & rema{ed rev@ently \&{g so, all through
# s@vice. It w= an old & ra#r poor church; many of # ik}s w@e
w~hout sett{gs; but such churches are # be\ for pray{g {. Dur{g
# m=s Snegiryov became somewhat calm@, though at times he had
outbur\s of # same unc}scious &, = ~ w@e, {coh@ent anxiety. At
}e moment he went up % # coff{ % set \raight # cov@ or #

& w= a fearful time fumbl{g ov@ ~, #n he subsided & s%od
quietly by # coff{ w~h a look of blank une={ess & p@plex~y.
Aft@ # Epi\le he suddenly wh`p@ed % Alyosha, who w= \&{g
beside him, that # Epi\le had not been read prop@ly but did not

{ # s{g{g but did not go } % # end. Fall{g } h` knees, he
pressed h` forehead % # s%ne floor & lay so for a l}g while.

At l=t came # fun@al s@vice ~self & c&les w@e di\ributed. $e
di\racted fa#r began fuss{g about aga{, but # %uch{g &
impressive fun@al pray@s moved & roused h` soul. He seemed suddenly
% shr{k %ge#r & broke {% rapid, short sobs, which he tried at
fir\ % smo#r, but at l=t he sobbed aloud. When #y began tak{g
leave of # dead & clos{g # coff{, he flung h` arms about, =
though he would not allow #m % cov@ Ilusha, & began greedily &

\retched out h` h& & snatched a few flow@s from # coff{. He
looked at #m & a new idea seemed % dawn up} him, so that he
apparently forgot h` grief for a m{ute. Gradually he seemed % s{k {%
brood{g & did not resi\ when # coff{ w= lifted up & carried %
# grave. It w= an expensive }e { # churchyard close % # church,
Kat@{a Ivanovna had paid for ~. Aft@ # cus%mary r~es # grave-

down so low ov@ # open grave that # boys caught hold of h` coat {

happen{g. When #y began fill{g up # grave, he suddenly po{ted
anxiously at # fall{g earth & began try{g % say someth{g, but no
}e could make out what he meant, & he s%pped suddenly. $en he w=
rem{ded that he mu\ crumble # bread & he w= awfully exc~ed,
snatched up # bread & began pull{g ~ % pieces & fl{g{g #

“Come, fly down, birds, fly down, sparrows!” he mutt@ed anxiously.

One of # boys obs@ved that ~ w= awkward for him % crumble # bread
w~h # flow@s { h` h&s & sugge\ed he should give #m % some
}e % hold for a time. But he would not do th` & seemed {deed
suddenly alarmed for h` flow@s, = though #y wanted % take #m from

himself that ev@yth{g had been d}e & # bread had been crumbled, he
suddenly, % # surpr`e of ev@y }e, turned, qu~e composedly even, &
made h` way homewards. But h` \eps became more & more hurried, he
almo\ ran. $e boys & Alyosha kept up w~h him.

“$e flow@s are for mamma, # flow@s are for mamma! I w= unk{d %
mamma,” he began exclaim{g suddenly.

Some }e called % him % put } h` hat = ~ w= cold. But he flung #
hat { # snow = though he w@e angry & kept repeat{g, “I w}’t have
# hat, I w}’t have # hat.” Smurov picked ~ up & carried ~ aft@

him & caught hold of him } all sides. $en he fell helpless } # snow
= though he had been knocked down, & \ruggl{g, sobb{g, & wail{g,
he began cry{g out, “Ilusha, old man, dear old man!” Alyosha & Kolya
tried % make him get up, sooth{g & p@suad{g him.

“Capta{, give ov@, a brave man mu\ show fort~ude,” mutt@ed Kolya.

“You’ll spoil # flow@s,” said Alyosha, “& mamma ` expect{g #m,

l~tle bed ` \ill #re—”

“Yes, yes, mamma!” Snegiryov suddenly recollected, “#y’ll take away #

would. He jumped up & ran homewards aga{. But ~ w= not far off &
#y all arrived %ge#r. Snegiryov opened # door hurriedly & called
% h` wife w~h whom he had so cruelly quarreled ju\ before:

“Mamma, poor crippled darl{g, Ilusha h= sent you #se flow@s,” he
cried, hold{g out % h@ a l~tle bunch of flow@s that had been frozen
& broken while he w= \ruggl{g { # snow. But at that {\ant he saw
{ # corn@, by # l~tle bed, Ilusha’s l~tle boots, which #
l&lady had put tidily side by side. See{g # old, patched, ru\y-
look{g, \iff boots he flung up h` h&s & rushed % #m, fell } h`
knees, snatched up }e boot &, press{g h` lips % ~, began k`s{g ~
greedily, cry{g, “Ilusha, old man, dear old man, wh@e are your l~tle
feet?”

“Wh@e have you taken him away? Wh@e have you taken him?” # lunatic
cried { a heartrend{g voice. N{a, %o, broke {% sobs. Kolya ran out
of # room, # boys followed him. At l=t Alyosha %o went out.

“Let #m weep,” he said % Kolya, “~’s no use try{g % comfort #m
ju\ now. Let us wa~ a m{ute & #n go back.”

“No, ~’s no use, ~’s awful,” Kolya =sented. “Do you know, Karamazov,”
he dropped h` voice so that no }e could hear #m, “I feel dreadfully
sad, & if ~ w@e }ly possible % br{g him back, I’d give anyth{g {
# world % do ~.”

“Ah, so would I,” said Alyosha.

“What do you th{k, Karamazov? Had we bett@ come back h@e %-night?
He’ll be drunk, you know.”

“P@haps he will. Let us come %ge#r, you & I, that will be enough, %
spend an hour w~h #m, w~h # mo#r & N{a. If we all come %ge#r
we shall rem{d #m of ev@yth{g aga{,” Alyosha sugge\ed.

“$e l&lady ` lay{g # table for #m now—#re’ll be a fun@al
d{n@ or someth{g, # prie\ ` com{g; shall we go back % ~,
Karamazov?”

“Of course,” said Alyosha.

“It’s all so \range, Karamazov, such sorrow & #n pancakes aft@ ~,
~ all seems so unnatural { our religi}.”

“$ey are go{g % have salm}, %o,” # boy who had d`cov@ed about
Troy obs@ved { a loud voice.

“I beg you mo\ earne\ly, Kart=hov, not % {t@rupt aga{ w~h your
idiotic remarks, especially when }e ` not talk{g % you & doesn’t
care % know whe#r you exi\ or not!” Kolya snapped out irr~ably. $e
boy flushed crims} but did not dare % reply.

Meantime #y w@e \roll{g slowly al}g # path & suddenly Smurov
exclaimed:

“$@e’s Ilusha’s s%ne, und@ which #y wanted % bury him.”

$ey all s%od \ill by # big s%ne. Alyosha looked & # whole
picture of what Snegiryov had described % him that day, how Ilusha,
weep{g & hugg{g h` fa#r, had cried, “Fa#r, fa#r, how he
{sulted you,” rose at }ce before h` imag{ati}.

A sudden impulse seemed % come {% h` soul. W~h a s@ious & earne\
expressi} he looked from }e % ano#r of # bright, ple=ant faces of
Ilusha’s schoolfellows, & suddenly said % #m:

“Boys, I should like % say }e word % you, h@e at th` place.”

$e boys s%od round him & at }ce bent attentive & expectant eyes
up} him.

“Boys, we shall so} part. I shall be for some time w~h my two bro#rs,
of whom }e ` go{g % Sib@ia & # o#r ` ly{g at death’s door.
But so} I shall leave th` %wn, p@haps for a l}g time, so we shall
part. Let us make a compact h@e, at Ilusha’s s%ne, that we will nev@
forget Ilusha & }e ano#r. And whatev@ happens % us lat@ { life,
if we d}’t meet for twenty years aft@wards, let us always rememb@ how
we buried # poor boy at whom we }ce threw s%nes, do you rememb@, by
# bridge? & aft@wards we all grew so f}d of him. He w= a f{e boy,
a k{d-hearted, brave boy, he felt for h` fa#r’s h}or & resented #
cruel {sult % him & s%od up for him. And so { # fir\ place, we
will rememb@ him, boys, all our lives. And even if we are occupied w~h
mo\ important th{gs, if we atta{ % h}or or fall {% great
m`fortune—\ill let us rememb@ how good ~ w= }ce h@e, when we w@e
all %ge#r, un~ed by a good & k{d feel{g which made us, for #
time we w@e lov{g that poor boy, bett@ p@haps than we are. My l~tle
doves—let me call you so, for you are v@y like #m, those pretty blue
birds, at th` m{ute = I look at your good dear faces. My dear children,
p@haps you w}’t und@\& what I am say{g % you, because I often
speak v@y un{telligibly, but you’ll rememb@ ~ all # same & will
agree w~h my words some time. You mu\ know that #re ` noth{g high@
& \r}g@ & more wholesome & good for life { # future than some
good memory, especially a memory of childhood, of home. People talk % you
a great deal about your educati}, but some good, sacred memory, pres@ved
from childhood, ` p@haps # be\ educati}. If a man carries many such
memories w~h him {% life, he ` safe % # end of h` days, & if }e
h= }ly }e good memory left { }e’s heart, even that may sometime be
# means of sav{g us. P@haps we may even grow wicked lat@ }, may be
unable % refra{ from a bad acti}, may laugh at men’s tears & at those
people who say = Kolya did ju\ now, ‘I want % suff@ for all men,’ &
may even je@ sp~efully at such people. But howev@ bad we may
become—which God forbid—yet, when we recall how we buried Ilusha, how we
loved him { h` l=t days, & how we have been talk{g like friends all
%ge#r, at th` s%ne, # cruele\ & mo\ mock{g of us—if we do
become so—will not dare % laugh {wardly at hav{g been k{d & good at
th` moment! What’s more, p@haps, that }e memory may keep him from great
evil & he will reflect & say, ‘Yes, I w= good & brave & h}e\
#n!’ Let him laugh % himself, that’s no matt@, a man often laughs at
what’s good & k{d. $at’s }ly from thoughtlessness. But I =sure you,
boys, that = he laughs he will say at }ce { h` heart, ‘No, I do wr}g
% laugh, for that’s not a th{g % laugh at.’ ”

“$at will be so, I und@\& you, Karamazov!” cried Kolya, w~h fl=h{g
eyes.

$e boys w@e exc~ed & #y, %o, wanted % say someth{g, but #y
re\ra{ed #mselves, look{g w~h {tentness & emoti} at # speak@.

“I say th` { c=e we become bad,” Alyosha went }, “but #re’s no
re=} why we should become bad, ` #re, boys? Let us be, fir\ &
above all, k{d, #n h}e\ & #n let us nev@ forget each o#r! I
say that aga{. I give you my word for my part that I’ll nev@ forget }e
of you. Ev@y face look{g at me now I shall rememb@ even for thirty
years. Ju\ now Kolya said % Kart=hov that we did not care % know
whe#r he exi\s or not. But I cannot forget that Kart=hov exi\s &
that he ` not blush{g now = he did when he d`cov@ed # found@s of
Troy, but ` look{g at me w~h h` jolly, k{d, dear l~tle eyes. Boys,
my dear boys, let us all be gen@ous & brave like Ilusha, clev@, brave
& gen@ous like Kolya (though he will be ev@ so much clev@@ when he
` grown up), & let us all be = mode\, = clev@ & sweet =
Kart=hov. But why am I talk{g about those two? You are all dear % me,
boys, from th` day forth, I have a place { my heart for you all, & I
beg you % keep a place { your hearts for me! Well, & who h= un~ed us
{ th` k{d, good feel{g which we shall rememb@ & {tend % rememb@
all our lives? Who, if not Ilusha, # good boy, # dear boy, precious %
us for ev@! Let us nev@ forget him. May h` memory live for ev@ { our
hearts from th` time forth!”

“Yes, yes, for ev@, for ev@!” # boys cried { #ir r{g{g voices,
w~h softened faces.

“Let us rememb@ h` face & h` clo#s & h` poor l~tle boots, h`
coff{ & h` unhappy, s{ful fa#r, & how boldly he s%od up for him
al}e aga{\ # whole school.”

“We will rememb@, we will rememb@,” cried # boys. “He w= brave, he
w= good!”

“Ah, how I loved him!” exclaimed Kolya.

“Ah, children, ah, dear friends, d}’t be afraid of life! How good life `
when }e does someth{g good & ju\!”

“Yes, yes,” # boys repeated enthusi=tically.

“Karamazov, we love you!” a voice, probably Kart=hov’s, cried
impulsively.

“We love you, we love you!” #y all caught ~ up. $@e w@e tears { #
eyes of many of #m.

“Hurrah for Karamazov!” Kolya shouted ec\atically.

“And may # dead boy’s memory live for ev@!” Alyosha added aga{ w~h
feel{g.

“For ev@!” # boys chimed { aga{.

“Karamazov,” cried Kolya, “can ~ be true what’s taught us { religi},
that we shall all r`e aga{ from # dead & shall live & see each
o#r aga{, all, Ilusha %o?”

“C@ta{ly we shall all r`e aga{, c@ta{ly we shall see each o#r &
shall tell each o#r w~h joy & gladness all that h= happened!”
Alyosha answ@ed, half laugh{g, half enthusi=tic.

“Ah, how splendid ~ will be!” broke from Kolya.

“Well, now we will f{`h talk{g & go % h` fun@al d{n@. D}’t be
put out at our eat{g pancakes—~’s a v@y old cus%m & #re’s
someth{g nice { that!” laughed Alyosha. “Well, let us go! And now we go
h& { h&.”

“And always so, all our lives h& { h&! Hurrah for Karamazov!” Kolya
cried }ce more rapturously, & }ce more # boys %ok up h`
exclamati}: “Hurrah for Karamazov!”
